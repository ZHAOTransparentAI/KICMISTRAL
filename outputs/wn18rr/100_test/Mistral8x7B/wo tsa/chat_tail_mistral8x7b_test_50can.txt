The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (trade name, _member_of_domain_usage of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _member_of_domain_usage of trade name? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (telephone, _verb_group of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _verb_group of telephone? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

From the additional examples provided, I can see that I should also take into account the outlined relations in order to sort the candidate answers. This means that I should prioritize candidates that have a _synset\_domain\_topic\_of_ relation with "telephone" as "telephony", and candidates that are _derivationally\_related\_form_ to "telephone" as "telephone set".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (transfix, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of transfix? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting.

Understood. From the examples provided, I can see that the task involves predicting the hypernym of a given entity. The entity and the word "hypernym" are provided, and the goal is to fill in the blank with the correct hypernym. This suggests that the task requires knowledge of taxonomy and the ability to identify the category or class to which a given entity belongs. The examples also show that the entity can be a variety of things, such as a verb (make), a

Based on the supplementary information provided, I can see that the task may involve not only hypernyms, but also derivationally related forms. This suggests that the task requires an understanding of linguistic relationships between words, as well as taxonomic relationships.

From the first and fourth examples, I can infer that "spear" and "pin" are related to "transfix" through a hypernym relationship. This means that "transfix" is the hypernym of both

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (mayhem, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of mayhem? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (railroading, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of railroading? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

From the examples, I can summarize the way of thinking as predicting the hypernym (a word or phrase that represents a category or class of words) of the given entity by understanding the relationship between the given entity and the hypernym. To do this, I need to carefully analyze the given entity, and use my knowledge to identify the appropriate hypernym that accurately represents a higher-level category for that entity. The examples also suggest that the hypernym can be a more general concept that includes

From the additional examples that provide supplementary information, I can further understand the concept of derivationally related forms, which are words that share a common origin or have a historical relationship. For example, the words "railroading" and "railroad" are derivationally related, as they both contain the same root word but with different endings. By recognizing this relationship, I can use it to understand the given entity and associated derivationally related form, which can help

The additional examples provided further reinforce the concept of hypernyms, or words that represent a higher level in the hierarchical organization of concepts. For instance, the hypernym of "genus caretta" is "reptile genus", and the hypernym of "hipsters" is "youth subculture". These examples demonstrate that even when the given entity is more complex or specific, the approach to identifying the hypernym remains similar.

These additional examples illustrate the concept of hypernyms for more varied and specific entities. For example, the hypernym of "jew's-ears" is "jelly fungus", and the hypernym of "motorization" is "implementation". These examples demonstrate that the approach to identifying hypernyms still holds even for less common or technical entities. Additionally, the last example of "comatoseness" highlights the importance of understanding the specific context and connotation

I understand, in these examples, the goal is to predict the tail entity or the hypernym based on the given entity and its definition or characteristics. The analogies demonstrate that in order to predict the hypernym, one must have a clear understanding of the relationship between the entities, and be able to identify the commonalities and differences between them. This requires a strong ability to analyze and categorize the entities.

Based on the examples provided, I can see that the goal question is asking me to predict the hypernym of a given entity. In each example, the entity is presented along with a relationship (indicated by the "_hypernym of" phrasing), and my task is to complete the sentence by providing the hypernym. I can also see that the examples cover a range of entity types, from objects and body parts to more abstract concepts. This suggests that I should be prepared to handle a variety

From the supplementary information provided, I can see that there are additional relationships beyond just the hypernym relationship that I need to be aware of. The "_derivationally_related_form of" relationship suggests that I may need to consider variations on the given entity, such as different forms or spellings. The example of "grant-in-aid" and its hypernym "grant" also shows that I need to be prepared to handle compound entities, where the relationship may apply

Based on these additional examples, I can see that the hypernym relationship can apply to a wide range of entity types, from scientific categories to cultural concepts and physical objects. I also see that the hypernym may be a more general category or class that the given entity belongs to. This information will be helpful in allowing me to identify the appropriate hypernym for the goal question. Additionally, I will keep in mind the possibility of compound entities and variations in spelling or form when considering the candidate answers.

From these examples, I can observe that the hypernym prediction task involves determining the broader class or category that the given concept belongs to. I also noticed that the examples cover a wide variety of domains, including physiology, semantics, chemistry, and performance.

For instance, puerility is a type of immaturity, and part-to-whole relation is a type of semantic relation. I will keep this insight in mind as I perform the hypernym prediction

From these examples, I can see that the task is to identify the broader category or class of the given entity. These examples show that a collage film is a type of picture show, a fisherman's lure is a type of lure, yelling is a type of yell, and a diesel locomotive is a type of railway locomotive. By using this analogy, I can infer that tinned goods are a type of hypernym, and the answer

By carefully reading, analyzing, and summarizing the information presented in the new examples, I am able to further understand the task and remember information that may be helpful for the sorting task.

From the first example, I understand that sorrow is a type of unhappiness. This helps me understand that when looking for the hypernym of an emotion, I should consider broader emotional categories.

From the second example, I understand that muharrum is a type of is

From these examples, I can see that the hypernym of an entity may not always be a direct superordinate in the hierarchy, and may require broader inference.

For instance, an abortionist is a type of physician and a suspect is a type of venture. This analogy can help me infer that tinned goods are a type of structure or container, and ecclesiastical benefice is a type of spiritual organization or institution.

By considering the given examples, I understand that the task is to predict the hypernym of a given entity, which is the broader category or class to which the entity belongs.

For instance, dita bark is a hyponym of tree, modernize is a hyponym of change, and textual criticism is a hyponym of literary criticism. Therefore, if I am given a new entity, I should consider its broader category or class to predict its hypernym.

From these examples, I understand that the task is to predict the hypernym of the given entity by inferring the broader class or category that the entity belongs to. In the first example, the hypernym of "freeze" is "put under," which means that freeze is a specific type of action that can be categorized under "put under."

I understand. Based on the given examples, I will use analogy and summarize the following way of thinking:

1. Analyze the given relationship between the first and second entities (e.g. praise and [MASK])
2. Identify the pattern in the provided examples for the given relationship
3. Compare the given context with the examples to predict the tail entity ([MASK])
4. Relate extra information to mine potential relationships among entities.

I understand, I will also incorporate the additional information from the examples which shows the pattern that:

1. If the first entity is "praise" and the relationship is "_derivationally\_related\_form of", then the tail entities are the same ([MASK] = praise)
2. If the relationship is "_hypernym of", the first entity is a hyponym of the tail entity ([MASK]). Here, the hyponyms ("compliment

Based on the given examples, I recognize the pattern that the tail entity to be predicted is a word that has a derivational relationship with the given entity. I will use this way of thinking and the information from the examples to help sort the candidate answers for the goal question. In addition, I will continue to look for supplementary information that can help me mine potential relationships between the given entity and the candidate answers.

Based on the given examples with supplementary information, I recognize that some entities have multiple relationships, such as derivational relationships and hypernym relationships. I will consider these relationships as I sort the candidate answers for the goal question. The given example with "glade" and "clear" also suggests that the direction of the relationship can be reversed. I will keep this information in mind while completing the sorting task.

These additional examples will help me further understand the task, specifically the concept of _derivationally\_related\_form_. From these examples, I can see that the task involves predicting a word that is related to the given word in a specific way. The word should be a form of the given word that can be derived from it through morphological processes.

For instance, in the first example, the answer is "registrar" which is a word that is related to "

These analogical examples will help me understand that the derivationally\_related\_form relationship can involve adding various suffixes or modifying the root word to different degrees. In some cases, the relationship may be straightforward, such as in the first example where "trail" and "trailer" only differ by a single letter.

On the other hand, some examples may be less straightforward, such as in the fourth example where the derivationally\_related\_form of "touch

******
Understood, I've noted the relationships between the given word and the tail entity in each example. Additionally, the tail entity in each example acts as a synonym, or descriptive attribute, or action to the given word. I will use this insight during the sorting task to prioritize candidate answers that act similarly.

******
I understand, I've taken note of the examples and their analogies. For the first example, "eat" and "_also\_see of" are related to "polish off", as the latter suggests an action that can be a result of eating. Similarly, "joyous" is related to "regimentation", as the latter can lead to the former. "Flare" is related to "_also\_see of" and to itself, as they share the same meaning
