 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

A meronym is a part or a member of a whole, and in this case, it refers to a genus-species relationship between the two biological classes. Specifically, rickettsia is a member of rickettsiaceae, and rickettsiaceae is a member of rickettsiales. This information will be helpful in

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (phylum entoprocta, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word phylum entoprocta? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

From the examples, I gather that the task is to predict the tail entity that completes the given analogy by being a broader category of the provided entity. The tail entity can be determined by finding a hypernym or a more general category.

* For "make", a broader category is "modify".
* For "physical object", a broader category is "physical entity".
* For "garnet", a broader category is "transparent gem".

******
From the additional examples, I gather that the task can also involve finding a meronym or a part of the provided entity in certain cases.

* For "polyzoa", a meronym is "phylum entoprocta".

This information will help me in completing the sorting task, as I will be able to identify whether the relationship between the provided entity and the tail entity is that of a hypernym or a meronym.

Thank you for the examples. Based on these examples, I will look for candidate answers that are derivationally related to the given word, and are likely related in meaning. I will sort the candidates from most relevant to least relevant based on how closely they match the pattern established in the examples.

From the supplementary information, I see that some words may have multiple derivationally related forms, and that the answer can still be considered correct even if it is not a direct derivation. Additionally, the same answers can appear in multiple examples, so it's important to consider the context in which the answers appear. I will keep this information in mind as I sort the candidate answers.

Thank you for the examples. From the given examples, I can infer that the task requires me to predict a word that is derivationally related to the given word and can be obtained by applying a certain rule or process. The given examples suggest that the derived word may not always be a common or obvious derivative but rather a word that has a lesser-known or more specific meaning related to the original word.

In the first example, the word "effect" is a derivative of the word

Thank you for the supplementary information. From the given additional examples, I can infer that the words "fade" and "vanish" have a derivational relationship with each other, as well as the words "vanish" and "vanisher". This suggests that the derived word may have a different form, such as adding a suffix or prefix to the original word or changing the tense or number of the word.

Additionally, the fact that "fade" is a derivative

I understand that the relationship between the answer and the missing word is not always directly related or synonymous, but can be related in a more indirect or metaphorical way. For example, in the last example, the answer and the missing word are both words that relate to a lack of power, but they are not synonyms. I will consider these indirect and metaphorical relationships when sorting the candidate answers for the goal question.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers in order of relevance to the goal question.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (sops, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a word derivated from the word sops? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

I understand, I will use these examples to inform my approach to the sorting task. Based on the given examples, the goal question seems to be asking for a word that is related to the given word (sops) by being a derived form of that word. From the examples, it appears that the answer can be a word that is either a direct derivative of the given word or a word that is somehow related to the given word through a derived form. I will use this information to guide

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (host, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word host? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

I understand the provided supplementary information examples. Here are my observations and thoughts based on them:

1. In the examples, I find that the first entity (master of ceremonies, host, junket, and emcee) can be further described by a relationship, i.e., derivationally related form or hypernym.
2. For the derivationally related form, the relationship involves finding a word that can be derived from the original word (master of ceremonies

I will utilize the new analogy examples for further understanding of the task:

1. In these examples, the first entity is described by a hypernym relationship that helps to identify a broader category for the given word.
2. The given examples have answers with different naming conventions, for example, reptile genus, youth subculture, portion, and exchange. This could suggest that the naming convention for the answer may vary for the main task as well.

From the supplementary information, I can see the following:

1. The supplementary examples emphasize the derivationally related form by associating the first entity with a word that can be derived from it.
2. The given examples show that the word derived from the initial input can either follow the same format or differ, with the applicability to the main task remaining unchanged.

I will continue studying the new analogy examples to further refine the understanding of the task. Here are the observations I made:

1. The analogy examples mainly focus on hypernym relationships that help categorize the given terms to their broader domains (jelly fungus, implementation, carbonate, and unconsciousness).

From the examples provided, I understand that the goal question is asking for a word that can be derived from the given word, which may or may not be directly related to the given word. I will use this understanding to carefully consider each candidate answer and sort them based on their relevance and potential as a derived word from the given "hostility" prompt. I will also remember any extra information that may be helpful in determining the relevance of the candidate answers.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

I understand. Based on the examples, the task is to predict the tail entity of the given tuple by determining the broader category or hypernym of the second entity, which is indicated by the phrase "_hypernym of". The given examples show that the tail entity can be inferred based on the relationship between the broader category of the second entity and the first entity. I will keep this thinking in mind for the sorting task.

I understand. The supplementary information in the examples provides additional context regarding the relationship between the entities in the tuple. The first supplementary example indicates that the tail entity can be a "part or a member" of the second entity, which is referred to as a "_member\_meronym of". The second and third supplementary examples use the relationship "_derivationally\_related\_form of" to indicate that the tail entity can be a form of the second entity or vice versa.

Based on the additional examples, I see that the hypernym of the second entity can be a more general category that encompasses the second entity. The first example indicates that a broader category for "genus caretta" is "reptile genus". Similarly, the second example indicates that a broader category for "hipsters" is "youth subculture". This suggests that for the original question, I should look for a broader category for the word "number". The last two examples

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (tinned goods, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word tinned goods? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Understood. From the examples provided, I can see that the task involves predicting a word that can be derived from a given word. This requires understanding the meaning and context of the given word, and then generating a word that has a related but distinct meaning and can be derived from the given word through processes such as prefixes, suffixes, or conversions.

In the first example, the given word is "set up", and the derived word is "effect", which shares a

Understood. Based on these additional examples, it appears that the derivationally-related forms of a given word can include not just new words formed from the given word, but also words that are formed from or associated with the given word.

Thank you for the additional examples. Based on the new information, it seems that the relationship between the given word and the answer can be a bit more nuanced than simply being a derivative form of the given word. In the last example, "ostracize" and "ostracism" are related in meaning but not necessarily derivative forms of each other.

Therefore, I will consider both derivative forms and words with related meanings when predicting the tail entity from the given examples.

I will keep these examples in mind and use them to analogy the goal question. From the given examples, I understand that the task is to predict the broader category of the provided word by filling in the [MASK] of the hypernym of a certain word. The given answers in the examples are "modify", "physical entity", "transparent gem", and "basal ganglion". These answers give me a sense of the level of abstraction required in the answer.

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (genus caretta, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word genus caretta? The answer is ".

I will also consider these additional examples for analogy. From these examples, I see that the answers "reptile genus", "youth subculture", "portion", and "exchange" are also in line with the level of abstraction required for the answer. The first example gives me a sense that in certain contexts, the answer can include the word "genus" or a similar construct. The last example shows that the answer can be a word that is not

The additional examples also align with the previous observations. "Jelly fungus" aligns with the idea of a specific construct within a broader category. "Implementation" and "carbonate" further illustrate the level of abstraction that may be required for the answer. The last example with an answer of "unconsciousness" confirms that the answer could also be a more general concept or a state without the word "genus" or a similar construct. I will

The examples given so far cover various levels of abstraction and different types of entities and concepts. From these examples, I understand that the answer for the [MASK] can be a broader category of the given word, which can be a specific entity, a concept, or a relation. The level of abstraction in the answer can vary depending on the specific example and could include synonyms of the given word, broader categories, or concepts.

The additional examples further illustrate the variety in the possible answers for the [MASK]. These examples show that the answer can be a synonym or a more general category of the given word. The answer can also include a type or an extension of the given word, such as "railway locomotive" for "diesel locomotive".

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (sorrow, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word sorrow?

The examples provided cover even more diverse levels of abstraction and types of entities. I note that "unhappiness" is a more abstract concept than "sorrow" and "islamic calendar month" is a more specific construct than "muharrum". "Hire" is another example of an answer that represents a broader category or concept for the word "subcontract". The answer "set" for the hyponym "parallelize" is an indicator that the answer

The answers in these examples continue to show diversity and increasing levels of abstraction. In the example of "abortionist," the answer is "physician", which is a broader category of the word, and "spiritualty" as an answer for "ecclesiastical benefice" indicates that the answer can even be at a higher level than a hypernym.

At this point, I am ready to receive the candidate answers for the goal question. I will use

The variety of examples given, with their increasing levels of abstraction, helps me to understand the task better.

Based on the given examples, here are the strategies for predicting the tail entities:

1. Analyze the head entity and its broader category to understand the relationship between the two.
2. Identify the pattern in the broader categories and use that to predict the tail entity for a given head entity.
3. Be aware of the exceptions, such as the example of "give" being the broader category of "corn".
4. Keep expanding your knowledge and understanding

It appears that the hypernyms in the examples range from more general concepts (such as immaturity and semantic relation) to more specific categories (such as antibiotic drug and performance). I will use this information in sorting the candidate answers.

Understood. These additional examples show a broader range of hypernyms with some being more specific to the given entity (such as railway locomotive for diesel locomotive) and others being more general (such as yell for yelling or lure for fisherman's lure). Additionally, there is an example of a collage film and its hypernym, picture show, which is a less common usage of the task. I will keep this in mind when sorting the

Thank you for providing the additional supplementary information. Based on these examples, I can see that some words can be derived from multiple words or concepts, such as "tolerate" being a derivationally related form of both "allowance" and "permit." Additionally, I can see that the derivationally related forms can include both nouns and adjectives, such as "tolerance" being a related form of "tolerate."

Thank you for sharing these examples. Based on the analogy, I understand that the task is to predict the tail entity that can be derived from the given word. The clues for derivation are provided by the _derivationally\_related\_form of _ relation. Here are the key takeaways from the examples:

* The tail entity can be a word derived from the given word
* The relation _derivationally\_related\_form of _ provides clues

From the supplementary information examples, I understand that the relation _hypernym of _ provides a broader category for the given word. This information can be helpful in determining the correct tail entity if the answer of the question is a hyponym of the given word.

I understand. I will carefully analyze the given examples to extract useful information and relationships. Based on these examples, the task involves predicting the tail entity in a sentence by determining if the entity can be derived from the given word with the relationship "derivationally related form of." Additionally, there is a degree of variation or flexibility in the derived entity, such as "effect" for "set up," and "concurrency" for "hold." I will use this information and analysis to assist

I see. These other examples demonstrate alternative relationships that can exist between the original entity and the derived entity, depending on the provided prompt and context.

These examples provide further perspective on the diversity of the relationships that I can encounter in my sorting task.

I understand. These examples highlight different combinations of relationships between the original entity and the derived entity based on the given prompt and context.

I understand. Analyzing these examples reveals a few aspects to consider in the sorting task. Some cases have a simple relationship with very close or identical forms (hold on to hold, incubate to incubator), while others may have derivational forms that are still substantially related but carry more complex relationships (mindfulness to mindful, stabilization to stabilize).

I understand. Based on already discussed information, a relationship between "style" and "stylize" indicates that such relationships can be transitive in nature. This means if there is a derivational relationship between two words A and B (A -> B) and there is another derivational relationship between already derived word B and C (B -> C), then there is a possibility of A-C derivational relationship as well (A -> C).

Understood. I can see that the relationship between a word and its derived form can be based on a variety of factors:

1. Some words are equal to their derived forms, such as "structure" and "organization."
2. Some words can be modified into a verb form, like "calcium" to "calcify" and "organization" to "organize."
3. Others may involve complex relationships, where additional words are needed to represent a derived

Noted. In this task, I can observe that when looking for the derived words, sometimes the resulting answer will be a noun, a verb, or even an adjective, depending on the provided word. For example, "reverence" is related to "reverent", "promote" to "promotion" and "matter to" to "interestingness."

This task requires careful consideration of the relationships between the initial word and potential derived words.

Thank you for the additional examples. These examples illustrate that the derived word from the given prompt can sometimes be the same as the original word. In cases like "bed", "cry", and "notch", the potentially derived forms are simple synonyms of the original words.

These clarifications will assist in better understanding the variety of potential derived words for the sorting task.

Thank you. I have thought about these supplementary examples regarding "think," "vitality," "join forces," and "relativistic."

While most of these exhibited the original words, I also understood that some derivations lead to more complex expressions or phrases. For instance, "cooperation" provided a tail entity of "join forces" and "theory of relativity" gave "relativistic," a term describing the theory.

From the examples, I observe that the goal is to predict a broader category or hypernym of a given entity. The candidate answer is provided and I need to sort it based on whether it is a valid hypernym or a broader category of the given entity. The provided examples also demonstrate different categories of entities from objects to body parts to precious stones, implying that I should apply a general understanding of hierarchical relationships and taxonomy rather than relying on specific knowledge of any particular domain.

From the supplementary information, I should be aware of hierarchical relationships, hypernyms and broader categories, but also other relationships such as derivationally related forms or other possible relationships between entities.

The supplementary information provided additional examples illustrating the relationships between words.

I understand that I can use different types of relationships to determine the answer to the given question.

I observe that the relationship between these words in this set of supplementary examples is that of a derivational relationship, which indicates a relationship of one word being derived from another, often through prefixation, suffixation or inflection.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (wive, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word wive? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers in order of relevance to the goal question.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (set up, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a word derivated from the word set up? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting.

From the given examples, I can infer that the task is to predict the tail entity that can be derived from the given word. The tail entity can be a directly derived word from the given word or a word that can be derived with a slightly different form. In the first example, from the word "set up", the derived word is "effect". Similarly, in the second and third examples, the derived words are "misunderstand" and "concurrency" from the words "m

From the examples with supplementary information, I can further infer that there are several different relationships between the given word and the tail entity, including hypernym (a broader category) or derivationally related form (a derived word). In all the given examples, the tail entity is "set up", indicating that it is a hypernym of all the given words. Therefore, I will keep this information in mind and use it to sort the candidate answers.

From the new examples, I can see that the relationship between the given word and the tail entity can also be a derivationally related form with a different form, such as "record" and "registrar". In the last example, the given word and the tail entity are the same, which can also be possible. I will take all these relationships into account while sorting the candidate answers.

I understand. From the examples, I can see that the task involves predicting the tail entity that can be derived from the given word. The tail entity is a word that is derivationally related to the given word. I will use this thinking process to sort the candidate answers for the goal question. Additionally, the examples suggest that the derivationally related form may not always be the expected word, but rather a logical derivative of the given word. I will keep this in mind as well.
