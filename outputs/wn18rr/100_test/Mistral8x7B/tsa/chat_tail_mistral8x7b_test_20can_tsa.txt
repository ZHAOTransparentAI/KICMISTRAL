From the supplementary information, I see that some words may have multiple derivationally related forms, and that the answer can still be considered correct even if it is not a direct derivation. Additionally, the same answers can appear in multiple examples, so it's important to consider the context in which the answers appear. I will keep this information in mind as I sort the candidate answers.

Understood. From the last example, I can see that the given word and the answer may not always have a direct derivational relationship, as "matter to" is not a derivative of "interestingness", but rather a phrase that indicates a relationship. This indicates that the task is more complex than just looking for words that are derivationally related.

For sorting the candidate answers in this case, I have to consider the potential relationships that the given word may have with the

Understood. From these examples, it appears that the relationship between the given word and the answer can also be a semantic relationship, where the answer has a meaning that is related to the given word, but not necessarily a derivative.

For example, in the first example, "mixture" is a word that has a semantic relationship with "unify" as a mixture can be the result of unification of different things. Similarly, in the third example, "cry"

From the supplementary information provided, I understand that the given entity can have a derivationally related form that is derived from the original word.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (york, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word york? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

Thank you for the examples. I have analyzed them and understood the underlying thinking pattern as follows:

1. The [MASK] in each example is supposed to be a broader category of the given entity.
2. The answer maintains the semantic meaning and context of the input, and helps complete the sentence in a grammatically correct and meaningful way.
3. "Modify" is a hypernym of "make", "physical entity" is a hypernym of "

Based on the new supplementary information, I will update my previous analysis:

1. The given entity "york" could be a specific instance of a broader category, such as "royalty" in this case.
2. The hypernym should capture the semantic meaning of the specific instance (york) while being a broader, more general category.
3. The examples and the given information should still be analyzed together to properly sort the candidate answers for the given question

Here's the updated understanding based on the additional examples:

1. A broader category can encompass the given entity in various ways, such as taxonomically, culturally, categorically, etc., depending on the nature of the entity.
2. The correct hypernym should respect the semantics and relations presented by the specific instance (e.g., in the case of "break," an exchange is a broader sense if we think of it as a communicative

Here's the updated understanding based on the additional examples:

1. The broader categories can refer to fundamental properties, processes, or abstract concepts that the given entities relate to (puerility, part to whole relation, neomycin).

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (number, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word number? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (conduct, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word conduct? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

I have careful analyzed the examples. The way of thinking in these examples is to predict the tail entity that can be derived from the given word by completing the sentence "can be a word derived from the word [given word]". The examples suggest that the tail entity can be a word that is derivationally related to the given word, such as a verb form, a noun form, or a related concept.

The supplementary information in these examples suggests that the tail entity can also be a word that is a broader category or a more general term than the given word.

The supplementary information in these examples supports the previous conclusion that the tail entity can be a word that is a more general term or a broader category than the given word, in this case, the tail entity is "permit".

It also suggests that the tail entity can also be a word that is semantically related to the given word even if it is not derived from it. For example, in the given example, "permit" is not a word derived from "toler

I see, the examples suggest that the tail entity can be a word that is the stem of the given word, or a word that is formed by removing a suffix or prefix from the given word, such as hold on becomes hold and incubate becomes incubator. And also, in cases where the given word is a noun and the stem is a verb, the tail entity can be a verb as in the case of mindfulness -> mindful and stabilization -> stabilize.

I understand, the tail entity can also be a verb that is derived from a noun as in the case of calcium -> calcify, and organization -> organize, interrelationship -> relate, which means that the relationship between the given word and the tail entity is not only that it can be derived from it but also the reverse can be true.

Understood, I will keep thinking about these examples and the analogy to the goal question, but I will not output my thinking yet. Based on the examples, the goal question involves predicting the hypernym or broader category of the word "basketball court." From the given examples, it appears that I should consider the relationships between specific objects and their broader categories. This involves identifying commonalities and broader categories that may apply to the given entity. In the first example, "make"

Understood, I will keep thinking about the additional information provided in the examples and how it may apply to the sorting task for the candidate answers. The new examples provide information about synset domain topic of and has part of relationships with the given entity. This indicates that I should consider both general topics related to the entity as well as its components. These relationships can provide additional context and clues about potential answers and the way I should order the candidate answers. In the example where the given entity is

Based on the additional examples provided, I can see that the goal question requires me to identify the broader category or hypernym of the given entity. The new examples clarify that I should consider broader categories beyond just topics or components, as the original examples suggested. In these new examples, the answers refer to categories that go beyond the given entities, like "youth subculture" and "exchange." These answers give a sense of the level of abstraction required for the sorting task

Based on the examples provided, I can see that the level of abstraction needed for the sorting task varies depending on the given entity. In some cases, the answer is a broader category that is still very specific, like "jelly fungus" or "carbonate." In other cases, the answer is a more general category, like "youth subculture" or "exchange." Therefore, I need to be prepared to consider a range of potential answers and categor

Based on the additional examples, I can see that the level of abstraction required for the sorting task is related to the given entity, and it is important to consider the broader context of the entity as well. For example, in the case of "puerility," the answer is the more general "immaturity," while in the case of "neomycin," the answer is a more specific "antibiotic drug." Additionally, some of the examples involve abstract concepts,

Based on the additional examples, the hypernym of a given entity can be a broader category or a superordinate term, ranging from fairly specific to more general. For instance, the hypernym of "fisherman's lure" is "lure", which is relatively specific, while the hypernym of "puerility" is "immaturity", which is more general.

Based on the examples given, I understand that I need to predict the tail entity by determining a hypernym for the given entity that represents a broader category or concept. The hypernym can range from a relatively specific concept to a more general one, depending on the given entity. In the case of "sorrow," the hypernym "unhappiness" represents a broader but still specific concept. However, for "parallelize," the hypernym "set" is a much more general concept.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (stylize, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a word derivated from the word stylize? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting.

In the given examples, the task is to predict the tail entity in a sentence by identifying a word that is derivationally related to the provided word. Here are the helpful observations from the examples:

1. In the first example, "set up" and "effect" are related through the word "setup," which can be transformed into the verb "set up."
2. In the second example, "misunderstanding" and "misunderstand" are directly related

Based on the additional examples provided, here are the supplementary insights to help with the sorting task:

1. In the first new example, "way" and "stylize" are related through the word "style," which can be transformed into the verb "stylize."
2. In the second and third examples, "stylize" and "vogue," as well as "stylize" and "way," are clearly related, suggesting a bidirection

Based on the new set of examples, here are the insights for the analogy:

1. In the first example, the words "record" and "registrar" are related, suggesting a relationship between an action (recording) and a person responsible for it (the registrar keeping records).
2. In the second example, "recidivism" and "retrogress" are related, potentially indicating a link between negative actions in the past and deteriorating

******
Using the supplementary information given in the examples, I've gleaned some additional insights for the sorting task:

1. When considering the derivationally related form of "stylization" or "vogue," the answer is always "stylize." This shows that the derived word in the original question should have a strong connection to the core of the original word, which in this case, is the act of stylizing.
2. Based on the example

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (trail, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a word derivated from the word trail? The answer is ". The answer is trailer, so the [MASK] is trailer. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (stop over, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a word derivated from the word stop over?

******
As I analyze these additional examples, I observe the following:

1. In the "trail" and "stop over" examples, the words "trailer" and "stop" are derived from the verbs "trail" and "stop over." This pattern may suggest that the tail entity should represent the action or process rather than the indirect result in the case of the initial goal question.
2. For the "cook" and "touch" examples, the tail entities

******
Based on the provided supplementary information, my observations are:

1. For the first example, conventionalization is linked to the verb "stylize," making it clear that conventionalization is a related action or process of forming conventions within stylization.
2. The second example establishes the link between "style" and "stylize." This indicates that both words share a similar meaning, related to the manner or trend in a specific action or process.

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (hold on, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a word derivated from the word hold on?

******
Continuing the analysis, I find the following patterns in the examples:

1. In the "hold on" and "mindfulness" examples, the derived words are "hold" and "mindful," respectively, which are directly related to the original words in meaning but do not follow a simple pattern of suffixation or prefixation to come to those conclusions.
2. In the "incubate" example, "incubator" is the derived term. This relationship is distinct

******
My analysis leads me to refine the pattern for deriving the tail entity to be even more specific. In this particular case, for the given word "style," which can be the basis for deriving multiple different forms, I find that the correct answer will always be "stylize" when I focus on the relationship between these two specific words. With this information, let's proceed to order the candidate answers for the original question by their relevance to the given input.

For the original question, the correct tail entity remains elusive, as the present analogy provided doesn't quite fit the required context. This is why I must stay silent on providing the final answer until given the proper analogy, as each analogy reveals essential patterns for deducing the tail entity correctly. Continue to present the required information, and I will eventually identify the most relevant solution for the tail entity when exposed to the proper analogy.

******
The tail entities for the given analogy examples are "reverent," "promotion," "polluter," and "matter to." Based on the presented analogies, I can see that the relationship mainly revolves around deriving a related noun or adjective directly from the original word or slightly altering it.

While the specific tail entity for the original question remains unclear, I will keep this pattern in mind to ensure the provided answer aligns with this relationship.

From the examples, I observe that the goal is to predict a broader category or hypernym of a given entity. The candidate answer is provided and I need to sort it based on whether it is a valid hypernym or a broader category of the given entity.

From the supplementary information, I can see that the relationship between the entities is not limited to hypernym relationships but can also include derivationally related forms. In these examples, I see that words that are derivationally related to the given entity, such as "break" to "breaking" or "break" to "split up", can be accepted as the answer. This implies that I should consider a wider range of relationships between the entities, beyond just hierarchy, in sorting the candidate

From these additional examples, I can see that the entity hierarchy is not always immediately obvious and can require some knowledge of the specific domain.

These examples continue to demonstrate the importance of considering a wide range of relationships between the entities, including derivationally related forms and hierarchical relationships.

These examples demonstrate entities from various domains such as psychology, linguistics, pharmaceuticals, and arts, and they emphasize that the required hierarchy is broader in nature than just immediate parent, child relationships. In some instances, there are multiple levels of hierarchy, such as immaturity being a broader category of puerility, and human behavior being a broader category of immaturity. This reinforces my focus on understanding the relationships within the entities to perform the sorting task.

By understanding the derivational relationships between words, I can ensure that the sorted candidate list reflects this and placing related-forms higher in the order of relevance.

The second reverse statement emphasizes this understanding of relationships.

This understanding helps in the sorting task as well, as I can prioritize the candidates that are more specific instances or directly related concepts to the input, and place those that are broader in a lower position in the sorted list. For instance, if the input is "sorrow", I can prioritize unhappiness over emotions, as the latter would be too broad to fit the context.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers in order of relevance to the goal question.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (freight, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word freight? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Understood, I will keep the examples in mind and use them to guide my thinking when sorting the candidate answers. Based on the examples provided, the task involves predicting a broader category or hypernym for the given entity or concept. This requires understanding the context and relationships involved in each example.

In the first example, "make" is a specific action and the hypernym is "modify", which implies broader actions that involve changing or altering something.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (wive, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word wive? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

Understood, I will keep these examples in mind while I perform the sorting task for the goal question. The way of thinking in these examples seems to involve identifying a broader category for the given entity.

I have noted the given additional examples and will now prioritize candidates that are consistent with these examples:

1. The examples further show that sometimes the answer can be an action related to the given word.
2. An answer can reflect a state or a condition that resembles the given word.

Now, to order the candidate answers, I will prioritize the following:

1. Candidates that are direct synonyms of the word "take"

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (courageous, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a synonym of the word courageous? The answer is ". The answer is bold, so the [MASK] is bold. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (tip, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a synonym of the word tip?

******
I will keep in mind the following observations from the provided examples:

1. The tail entities in these examples are mainly synonyms or related concepts.
2. Sometimes, the provided examples might be somewhat misleading (like "tip" connected to "upset"), but the context and the given synonyms should help navigate these uncertain cases.

Now, I will order the candidate answers by prioritizing direct synonyms of "take" and analyzing their relevance
******
Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (hurtle, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a synonym of the word hurtle? The answer is ". The answer is drop anchor, so the [MASK] is drop anchor. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (independent, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a synonym of the word independent?

The answer is ". The answer is honourable, so the [MASK] is honourable. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Having analyzed the additional examples, I have noted the following:

1. Sometimes, the tail entities might be related sentences or idioms that are connotations of the given word.
2. When encountering unclear cases, the context and given synonyms should help determine the relevance.

Considering these points, I will prioritize the candidate answers with a strong semantic link to "take" and order them based on their relevance and closeness in meaning to
******
Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (same, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a synonym of the word same? The answer is ". The answer is equal, so the [MASK] is equal. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (unclean, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a synonym of the word unclean?

The answer is ". The answer is inconstant, so the [MASK] is inconstant. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
With the final set of examples, I have identified
the following:

1. Tail entities can sometimes be related to the connotation, aspect, or general meaning of the base word.
2. Some examples might seem less direct, but the context and given synonyms should still assist in determining their relativity to the base word.

Based on these observations, I will carefully order the
candidate answers based on their semantic links to the word "take", taking
******
Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (virtuous, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a synonym of the word virtuous? The answer is ". The answer is chaste, so the [MASK] is chaste. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (rough, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a synonym of the word rough? The answer is ". The answer is unsubdivided, so the [MASK] is unsubdivided. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (easy, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a synonym of the word easy?

The answer is ". The answer is clear, so the [MASK] is clear. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
After evaluating these examples, I have found that:

1. Tail entities can be single words or short phrases that are closely linked to the base word, whether as synonyms or in meaning.
2. When encountering unclear cases, the context and given synonyms should still guide the assessment of relevance.

Considering these lessons, I will prioritize the candidate answers that have a considerable semantic link to the word "take", and order them

The answer is ". The answer is impotent, so the [MASK] is impotent. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Following my analysis of the added examples, I observed:

1. Some tail entities are idiomatic expressions or phrases that share the base word's meaning.
2. The context and given synonyms are useful for determining the semantic relation of the candidate answer to the base word.

To order the candidate answers, I'll prioritize the following:

1. Answers that are synonymous or semantically similar to the base word "take"
******
The list of candidate answers is [purchase,stock up,trade,trade,take over,yiddish,sell,golf game,muslimism,government activity,preparation,self-assertive,religious belief,buy,take,deal,get,unfriendly,import,shop]. And the question is predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (take, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a synonym of the word take? The answer is ". Now, based on the previous examples and your own knowledge and thinking, sort the list to let the candidate answers which are more possible to be the true answer of the question more prior. Output the sorted order of candidate answers using the format "[most possible answer | second possible answer | ... | least possible answer]" and please start your response with "The final order:".

I understand. From the examples, I can see that the task involves predicting the tail entity that can be derived from the given word. The tail entity is a word that is derivationally related to the given word. I will use this thinking process to sort the candidate answers for the goal question. Additionally, the examples suggest that the derivationally related form may not always be the expected word, but rather a logical derivative of the given word. I will keep this in mind as well.

Additionally, I see that in some cases, the tail entity can be a broader category of the given word, such as when "top" is a hypernym of "pass." I will take these additional relationships into account when sorting the candidate answers for the goal question.

I understand. From the additional examples, I can see that the tail entity can sometimes be a word that is derivationally related to the given word, but not necessarily an expected form of the given word. The relationship between the given word and the tail entity can vary, and may not always be the same. I will use this information to sort the candidate answers for the goal question.

I understand. From these additional examples, I see that the derivational relationship between the given word and the tail entity can vary. In some cases, the tail entity is a more specific form of the given word, such as with "trail" and "trailer" or "stop over" and "stop." In other cases, the tail entity is the same as the given word, such as with "cook" and "touch." I will keep these patterns in mind as I sort

From looking at the additional examples provided, I can see that the answer may sometimes be the same as the original word, but it may also be a different form of the word that is related in meaning.

For instance, in the case of "top," the derived word "upside" is related in meaning but has a different form. In contrast, for "structure," the derived word is the same as the original word.

Similarly, for "calcium," the

From these examples, it appears that the tail entity may be a word that is related to the given word through a derivational relationship, such as a derivative or a related form. The relationship may not always be straightforward, and in some cases, the tail entity may not be a direct derivative of the given word, but rather a word that is associated with it in some way. For example, in the case of "interestingness," the tail entity is "matter to," which is a
