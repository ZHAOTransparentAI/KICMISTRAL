The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (rickettsiaceae, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word rickettsiaceae? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

From the examples, I can see that the pattern is to predict the tail entity that is a hypernym of the given entity. A hypernym is a broader category or a more general term that encompasses the given entity. In the examples, the given entities are "make", "physical object", "garnet", and "caudate nucleus", and the tail entities are their respective hypernyms "modify", "physical entity", "transparent gem", and

From the supplementary information, I can see that the relationship between the given entity and the tail entity can also be a meronym relationship. A meronym is a part or a member of a whole, and in this case, it refers to a genus-species relationship between the two biological classes. Specifically, rickettsia is a member of rickettsiaceae, and rickettsiaceae is a member of rickettsiales. This information will be helpful in

From the additional examples, I see that the pattern can also apply to different relationships, such as a genus-family relationship (with "genus caretta" and "reptile genus") and a culture-subculture relationship (with "hipsters" and "youth subculture"). I also see that the relationships can be more abstract, such as with "piece" and "portion". Overall, I will use this information to help me identify the broader category or more general

From these additional examples, I understand that the target tail entities can also be abstract concepts, such as "immaturity" and "semantic relation." Additionally, some of the examples have more complex relationships, like "part to whole relation" which has a broader category of "semantic relation." This further reinforces the pattern that I should look for the broadest category or hypernym of the given entity in order to predict the tail entity. I will keep this in mind and use this

I will use these additional examples to further refine my understanding of the relationship between the given word and the tail entity. These examples suggest that the tail entity may be a verb or a noun that is closely related to the given word or phrase, and may refer to the act of performing the action described by the given word, the result of the action described by the given word, or a more general concept related to the given word. I will use this insight to help me sort the candidate answers

From the supplementary information, I see that some words may have multiple derivationally related forms, and that the answer can still be considered correct even if it is not a direct derivation. Additionally, the same answers can appear in multiple examples, so it's important to consider the context in which the answers appear. I will keep this information in mind as I sort the candidate answers.

Thank you for the additional examples. From these examples, I see that sometimes the answer may not be a direct derivation of the given word, but rather a word that is related in meaning and has a similar derived form. I will consider these types of answers as well when sorting the candidate list.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers in order of relevance to the goal question.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (ski, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word ski? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers in order of relevance to the goal question.
******
The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (host, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word host? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

I understand the given examples. Here are my observations and thoughts based on the analogy examples:

1. Predicting the tail entity requires identifying a broader category for the first entity (host, make, physical object, garnet, or caudate nucleus).
2. The type of the answer can vary, but it appears to be consistent with the context provided (modify, physical entity, transparent gem, or basal ganglion).

I understand the provided supplementary information examples. Here are my observations and thoughts based on them:

1. In the examples, I find that the first entity (master of ceremonies, host, junket, and emcee) can be further described by a relationship, i.e., derivationally related form or hypernym.
2. For the derivationally related form, the relationship involves finding a word that can be derived from the original word (master of ceremonies

******
I will utilize the new analogy examples for further understanding of the task:

1. In these examples, the first entity is described by a hypernym relationship that helps to identify a broader category for the given word.
2. The given examples have answers with different naming conventions, for example, reptile genus, youth subculture, portion, and exchange. This could suggest that the naming convention for the answer may vary for the main task as well.

From the supplementary information, I can see the following:

1. The supplementary examples emphasize the derivationally related form by associating the first entity with a word that can be derived from it.
2. The given examples show that the word derived from the initial input can either follow the same format or differ, with the applicability to the main task remaining unchanged.

Now, I have a comprehensive understanding of the examples and their implications. I am ready to

I will continue studying the new analogy examples to further refine the understanding of the task. Here are the observations I made:

1. The analogy examples mainly focus on hypernym relationships that help categorize the given terms to their broader domains (jelly fungus, implementation, carbonate, and unconsciousness).
2. The examples display diverse naming conventions in their answers, which suggests that I should not anchor on the specific structure, as it is more likely that

Based on the given examples, I further understand how the relationships apply to their respective domains. I will assimilate this understanding for a more complete view of the task. In summary, I have observed that:

1. The examples show that hypernyms can be used to properly categorize various terms into broader domains.
2. The relationships in the examples are not restricted to a specific format or structure, as the given domain names follow varied conventions.

I will analyze the provided examples to ensure an accurate understanding of the varied contexts and structures. From the examples, I have gathered:

1. The examples range from tangible objects like the diesel locomotive, lure, and fisherman's lure to more abstract concepts like yell, yelling, picture show, and collage film.

I understand. Based on the examples, the task is to predict the tail entity of the given tuple by determining the broader category or hypernym of the second entity, which is indicated by the phrase "_hypernym of". The given examples show that the tail entity can be inferred based on the relationship between the broader category of the second entity and the first entity. I will keep this thinking in mind for the sorting task.

I understand. The supplementary information in the examples provides additional context regarding the relationship between the entities in the tuple. The first supplementary example indicates that the tail entity can be a "part or a member" of the second entity, which is referred to as a "_member\_meronym of". The second and third supplementary examples use the relationship "_derivationally\_related\_form of" to indicate that the tail entity can be a form of the second entity or vice versa.

Based on the additional examples provided, I see that there are two types of relationships that can be used to determine the tail entity: derivationally related form and hypernym.

For the first and fourth examples, the relationship is defined as derivationally related form. This means that the tail entity will be a word that is derived from the given word, such as "praise" being derived from "praise".

For the second and third examples, the relationship is defined as

Analyzing these additional examples, I notice that the relationship type is consistently defined as derivationally related form. The provided answer and the tail entity match, meaning the tail entity is a word that is derived from the given word.

In the first and the fourth examples, the provided answer and the tail entity match: registrar and record, think and think.

In the second and the third examples, the given word is first transformed to a less known or less used form,

In these additional examples, the relationship type is hypernym and derivationally related form.

For the first and the third examples, the relationship is defined as hypernym. The answer is a broader category of the provided word. The tail entity for pean is praise, and praise is a broader category for pean. For proclaim and praise, the relationship is defined as derivationally related form, meaning the tail entity will be a word that is derived from the given word.

These examples further illustrate the relationship type of derivationally related form. The related form of a word is created by adding a suffix, prefix, or transforming the word in a specific way.

In the first example, the related form is trailer, which is formed by adding the suffix "-er" to trail.

In the second example, the related form is stop, which is the stem or base form of the given word stop over.

In the third example,

The additional examples provided demonstrate the relationship of hypernym, where the tail entity is a broader category of the given word.

For example, in "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (praise, <i>hypernym of</i>, [MASK])", the answer is commendation, indicating that commendation is a broader category of the word praise.

Understood, I will keep thinking and analyzing the examples, but I will not output anything yet. Based on the given examples, it seems that the task not only involves predicting the tail entity that can be a part or a member of the given category or family but also requires knowledge of the hierarchy and relationships between different taxonomic classifications.

Based on the additional examples, the process involves predicting a tail entity that can be a part or a member of the given category or family. This requires knowledge of the hierarchy and relationships between different classifications, as well as the ability to infer the correct answer from the given context.

Based on the previous examples, the pattern seems to involve using the given category or family as a clue to identify a specific entity that can be a part or a member of that category.

I'm still thinking. Based on the examples, the goal is to predict the tail entity that can be a part or a member of the given category or family. However, the answer "ladle" in the "family corvidae" example suggests that the question may not always be asking for a subcategory of the given term, but rather anything that can be associated with it.

These examples confirm the pattern of finding a hypernym or broader category of the given entity, including more abstract concepts like a semantic relation and immaturity. The task involves understanding the context of the given entity and identifying a category that includes it. This information reinforces the approach I will take in sorting the candidate answers for the original question.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (ulmus carpinifolia, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word ulmus carpinifolia? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

I understand the analogy examples. The goal is to predict the hypernym or broader category of the given entity. In the first example, "make" is a physical object that can be modified, so the hypernym is "modify." In the second example, "physical object" can be classified as a "physical entity," so the hypernym is "physical entity." In the third example, "garnet" is a type of "transparent gem," so the

I understand that the additional examples provide supplementary information about meronyms, which are the parts that make up a whole. In this case, "ulmus carpinifolia" is a member or part of the "ulmus" genus, so the hypernym would be "ulmus carpinifolia." This information will help me sort the candidate answers for the original question, as I can now consider both hypernyms and meronyms when determining the broader category of "ulmus

Thank you for providing the examples. Based on these examples, I can infer that the goal question is asking for a component or constituent of the word "watt second" that can fill in the blank [MASK]. The word "watt second" is a unit of energy or action in physics, so the candidate answers should be related to this concept. I will keep this thinking in mind while sorting the candidate answers.

Thank you for the additional information. This confirms my previous understanding that the word "watt second" is a unit of energy or action in physics. The fact that "watt second" is a hyponym of "work unit" means that it is a specific type of work unit. I will keep this in mind while sorting the candidate answers, as any components or constituents of "watt second" should also be related to the concept of work units or energy.

I have carefully analyzed the additional examples, which suggest that the tail entity can be a semantically related word that shares a common concept or meaning with the given word, or a word that is a specific instance or subcategory of the given word. In the case of "hold on," the tail entity is a word that represents a basic or essential meaning that is shared by both "hold on" and "hold." Similarly, for "mindfulness," the tail entity "mindful" represents an

Thank you for the examples. From the analogy, I understand that the goal is to predict the tail entity that can be derived from the given word or a word that is semantically related. For instance, in the example of "unify," the tail entity is "mixture" which represents a state of being combined, which is a related concept.

Based on the given examples, I can infer that the tail entity can be:

From the examples, I observe that the goal is to predict a broader category or hypernym of a given entity. The candidate answer is provided and I need to sort it based on whether it is a valid hypernym or a broader category of the given entity. The provided examples also demonstrate different categories of entities from objects to body parts to precious stones, implying that I should apply a general understanding of hierarchical relationships and taxonomy rather than relying on specific knowledge of any particular domain.

Based on the presented analogies I can see that the task requires me to identify the broader category (hypernym) of a given entity, and to determine if the candidate answer matches the broader category. Also the analogies demonstrate that the presented entities could be various in nature, such as nouns, adjectives, subcultures or living beings, so the approach should be versatile and cover various possible relationships.

From these additional examples, I see that the relation "_derivationally\_related\_form of" can result in words that are derived from the original word, but the derived word can also be a synonym or a less common variant.

I understand the given examples. In each example, the task is to predict the hypernym or broader category of the given entity. Here's how I will summarize the way of thinking in these examples:

I understand the supplementary information given in the examples.

I understand the additional examples provided for analogy, and I will keep this analogy in mind while sorting the candidate answers. The new examples suggest that the hypernym of a given entity can vary widely based on the context and the specific entity, and that the hypernym can sometimes be quite abstract. I will consider the given entity in the context of the goal question and try to identify a hypernym that is broader than the given entity.

The last four examples indicate that when the relationship between the given word and the tail entity is a hypernym, the tail entity is the word "set up." This is true even if the given word has other hypernyms, such as "string" and "thread," which have broader categories in different contexts.

Therefore, I can conclude that when predicting the tail entity, the relationship between the given word and the tail entity can be either a hypernym or a derivation

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (warping, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word warping? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

I understand. By analyzing these examples, I will look for the pattern of predicting the tail entity by completing the sentence with a broader category of the given entity. In this case, the goal question is asking for the broader category of the word "warping". From the examples provided, I can infer that the given entity is a Hypernym of the broader category.

Additionally, the examples also give supplementary information that the broader category can be obtained from the answer of the

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers in order of relevance to the goal question.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (top, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a word derivated from the word top? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

I understand. From the examples, I can see that the task involves predicting the tail entity that can be derived from the given word. The tail entity is a word that is derivationally related to the given word. I will use this thinking process to sort the candidate answers for the goal question. Additionally, the examples suggest that the derivationally related form may not always be the expected word, but rather a logical derivative of the given word. I will keep this in mind as well.

From the supplementary information, I can see that the tail entity can sometimes be the same as the given word, such as in the case of "top" and "upside." Additionally, I see that in some cases, the tail entity can be a broader category of the given word, such as when "top" is a hypernym of "pass." I will take these additional relationships into account when sorting the candidate answers for the goal question.

I understand. From the additional examples, I can see that the tail entity can sometimes be a word that is derivationally related to the given word, but not necessarily an expected form of the given word. The relationship between the given word and the tail entity can vary, and may not always be the same. I will use this information to sort the candidate answers for the goal question.
