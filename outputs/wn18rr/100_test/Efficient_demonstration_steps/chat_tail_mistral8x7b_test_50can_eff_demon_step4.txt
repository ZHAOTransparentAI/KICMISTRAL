Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers to a given goal question in order of likelihood.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (telephone, _verb_group of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _verb_group of telephone? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting.

******
I understand. From the examples provided, I see that the task is to predict the tail entity in a sentence by completing a clause with a given verb group. The verb group acts as a hint to help determine the appropriate tail entity.

In the first example, given the verb group "of snap," the tail entity "take" is the correct answer. This suggests that the verb group "of snap" requires an action that can be taken, or something that can be taken with a snap

Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (telephone, _synset_domain_topic_of of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _synset_domain_topic_of of telephone?

******
From the supplementary information provided, I gather that there are additional relationships between the entities that can be determined through various properties such as synonyms, hypernyms, and derivationally related forms.

In the first new example, given the property "synset\_domain\_topic\_of" and the prompt "what is the synset\_domain\_topic\_of of telephone?", the answer is "telephony", which suggests that the property "synset\_domain\_topic

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (invite, _verb_group of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _verb_group of invite? The answer is ". The answer is invite, so the [MASK] is invite. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (universally, _verb_group of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _verb_group of universally? The answer is ". The answer is clear, so the [MASK] is clear. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (want, _verb_group of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _verb_group of want?

The answer is ". The answer is quiver, so the [MASK] is quiver. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on these examples, it appears that the verb group in the given clause can sometimes be the same as the answer and sometimes be different from the answer. When the verb group is the same as the answer, the tail entity appears to be a synonym or a more specific form of the verb group. When the verb group is different from the answer, the tail entity is a more general hypernym of the verb group or something that can be associated with the verb group.

In the case

From the additional examples, I can see that the relationships between entities can also be determined through properties such as derivationally\_related\_form, verb\_group, and hypernym.

In the first new example, given the property "derivationally\_related\_form" and the prompt "what is the derivationally\_related\_form of telephony?", the answer is "telephone", which suggests that telephony is a derivationally related form of telephone. The

******
Based on these additional analogous examples, it appears that when the verb group of the given entity is the same as the answer, the tail entity is the same as the given entity. This suggests that when the verb group and the given entity are the same, the tail entity should also be the same as the given entity, and not a different form or a hypernym of the given entity.

Given the additional supplementary information, I can see that the relationships between entities can be determined through various properties such as _derivationally\_related\_form and _hypernym. For example, if the property is _derivationally\_related\_form and the given entity is "telephoner", the tail entity can be inferred to be "telephone". Similarly, if the property is _hypernym and the given entity is "call in", the tail entity can be

******
From these analogous examples and the additional supplementary information provided, I can see that the tail entity for the given entity "telephone" can be inferred by looking for properties related to the word such as _derivationally\_related\_form and _hypernym. For example, the derivationally\_related\_form of telephony is telephone and a hypernym of cell phone is telephone. However, when the given verb group matches the answer, the tail entity will also match.

From the above analogies and supplemental information, we can summarize the way of thinking as follows:

1. When the goal question asks to predict the tail entity of a given entity, it requires us to find a word that is related to the given entity.
2. The given examples and additional information provide clues about how to find the tail entity by completing a sentence with a masked word, and then providing the answer.

From the above examples, I can observe that in some cases, the tail entity is the same as the given entity when the answer is the same as the verb group of the given entity. However, sometimes, the tail entity is a related word or phrase that completes the action or concept described by the verb group of the given entity, such as "carry" for "take" which suggests the idea of holding or moving an object.

I have read and analyzed the examples. Based on these examples, I have noted that the task involves predicting the derivationally related form of a given word.

Based on the supplementary information, I have identified a pattern where the hypernym of specific words, including "weakening," "sublimation," "shift," and "improvement," is "transmutation."

I have analyzed the additional examples. In these cases, the task is consistent with the previous examples in that it involves predicting the derivationally related form of a given word.

I have reviewed the new examples and noted that the derivationally related form of a given word can depend on the word's context or use.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (sympathizer, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of sympathizer? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

I have carefully read and analyzed the supplementary information. From these examples, I have gained further insight into the concepts of hypernyms and derivationally related forms.

A hypernym is a word that represents a general category or concept, while the original word provides a more specific meaning. For instance, philology represents a general category, and lexicology is a more specific instance within this category.

Following my review of the additional analogies, I can further discern the potential relationships between the given words and the tail entities. Some relationships might involve transformations, where the tail entity represents a modified or altered version of the original word. In other instances, the original word might undergo truncation or abbreviation, resulting in a more condensed or segmented version embodied in the tail entity. Additionally, there could be cases where the relationship between the original word and the tail entity

Continuing with my analysis of the additional analogies, I observe patterns wherein the original word can be converted to a verb form, representing the action or process. The examples suggest that the relationship can encompass transitive/intransitive verbs, or more generally, an action/process-driven form that stems from the original word. In other instances, the original word and the tail entity might be reciprocal or linked in meaning, depending on the context.

With my analysis of the new set of analogies, I can summarize the potential relationships between the original word and the tail entity:

1. The tail entity can represent an additional word derived from the root word, altering its meaning, often in verb form, for example, transforming "reverence" to "reverent."
2. Another possibility is that the original word corresponds to the action or reaction, while the tail entity can represent the result of this action,

As I continue to analyze the analogies, I notice various relationship types, which I've summarized below:

1. Similar to previous examples, the original word and the tail entity can share a similar meaning, such as "unify" and "mixture" or "weeping" and "cry."
2. Another observed relationship includes repetition or recursion, in which the original word and the tail entity are identical, as in the case of "bed" and

As I process the new examples, I obtained further insights and relationship patterns:

1. Some derivationally related forms result in changing the part of speech, like "think" becoming "thought" or "stimulate" becoming "vitality." Nouns are often the target forms.
2. The original word can be a general concept or main category, and the relationship leads to more specific instances, such as "theory of relativity" and "relativ

As I review these additional examples, the patterns I have observed showcase various relationships between the original words and their derivationally related forms:

1. Verbs are transformed into their noun forms or vice versa, like "take hold of" becoming "snatch" and "ostracize" changing to "ostracism."
2. The relationship between original words and target forms can include changing the level of specificity or detail, which may involve moving from a more general

2. Illustrating opposite behavior, vague terms or concepts converted into specific or explicit ones, with connections to actions or results

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers to a given goal question in order of likelihood.
******
The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (ski, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of ski? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

From the given examples, I can see that the task is to predict the hypernym of a given concept. A hypernym is a word or phrase that denotes a class or category of things of which the given concept is a member. In the first example, "make" is a type of action that can be modified, so the hypernym is "modify". In the second example, "physical object" is a type of "physical entity", so the hypernym is "phys

******
From the given examples, I can see that the task involves not only hypernyms but also other types of relationships, such as derivationally\_related\_form and synset\_domain\_topic\_of. Derivationally\_related\_form refers to a word-form which is related to another word-form by a transformation of a part of the word, such as the conversion of "ski" to "skiing". Synset\_domain\_topic\_of refers to the topic

These additional examples suggest that the task involves identifying a hypernym for a given concept, even if the concept is described by a more specific term such as a scientific name (e.g. genus caretta) or a common noun (e.g. piece). Additionally, the task may require knowledge of specific domains, such as biology, culture, or music.

I will keep these examples in mind and use them to guide my thinking when sorting the candidate answers for the given

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (thunder, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of thunder? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

From the examples, I understand that I need to predict the hypernym of the given entity, complete the given sentence, and sort the answer accordingly. To accomplish this, I will look for patterns or relationships between the given entity and the hypernym. In each example, I observe that the provided answer is more general and broadens the given entity. I will keep this thinking and relationship-mining in mind to process further examples and perform the sorting task accordingly.

Based on the supplementary information examples, it seems that I can use the context _derivationally_related_form to identify a relationship within the same word, making the given entity the answer itself. I will remember this additional context and related relationship, since it might influence the sorting process depending on the provided entities. Apart from considering hypernym relationships, I can also classify entities in other ways if the examples suggest other relevant relationships.

From the additional analogy examples, I observe that the hypernym relationship involves a shift from a more specific term to a more general one. I will analyze and sort the candidate answers accordingly, maintaining the relationship-mining and sorting based on the context within the hypernym relationship. As the given examples have shown, I will sort the candidates understanding that they might not follow the same relationship as in the _derivationally\_related\_form examples.

The examples I have analyzed show a hypernym relationship where the provided answer represents a more general category for the given entity. I will process and sort my candidate answers based on the examples' pattern, ensuring to determine a more general term for the given entity, always remembering the established context and the types of relationships I have learned from the provided examples.

After studying the additional analogy examples, I recognize a variety of relationships beyond just *hypernym*, such as *immaturity* being the hypernym of *puerility* and *performance* being the hypernym of *trick*. I will analyze my candidate answers according to the established context, focusing on identifying a more general term within the category of hypernym or other possible relationships that I might uncover while processing the examples.

After analyzing the given analogy examples, I observe that the answers provided are more generic compared to the original entities, despite having various relationships other than *hypernym*. I will keep this in mind and maintain an awareness that the relationships between the original entities and answers could involve broader categories or shared features. Thus, I will be prepared to identify and understand various relationship categories during the sorting process, which will be helpful in organizing the candidates according to the proper relationships with their corresponding categories.

Based on the given examples, the task involves predicting the hypernym of a given entity. A hypernym is a word or phrase that is more general than the given entity and represents a category or class that the entity belongs to. In the examples provided, the entities are "make", "physical object", "garnet", and "caudate nucleus". To sort the candidate answers for the goal question, I will look for the hypernym of the entity "grant"
******
Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (grant, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of grant?

Based on the supplementary information, I understand that the entity "grant" may have a derivationally related form that is the same as itself. Additionally, the entity "grant-in-aid" is a type of grant, which further confirms that "grant" is the hypernym of "grant-in-aid". These additional examples help to reinforce the concept of hypernymy and provide further context for sorting the candidate answers for the goal question.

The new examples further illustrate the concept of hypernymy, with entities such as "genus caretta" and "hipsters" being categorized as "reptile genus" and "youth subculture" respectively. These examples provide additional context and reinforce the idea of hypernymy as a relationship of inclusion. The examples also demonstrate that the entity being categorized can be a complex concept, such as a "youth subculture" or a "reptile genus

The latest examples demonstrate the versatility of hypernymy, as it is applied to concepts such as "jelly fungus", "implementation", "carbonate", and "unconsciousness". These examples show that hypernymy is a general relationship that can categorize various types of entities, from scientific concepts to medical conditions.

Now, having considered all the examples, I can sort the candidate answers for the goal question by identifying the hypernym of the given entity "

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers to a given goal question in order of likelihood.
******
The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (host, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of host? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.
******
Yes, I understand. I will carefully read and analyze the given examples, looking for patterns and relationships that may help me in sorting the candidate answers to the goal question. I will remain silent while you provide the examples.
******
Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (make, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of make? The answer is ". The answer is modify, so the [MASK] is modify. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (physical object, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of physical object? The answer is ". The answer is physical entity, so the [MASK] is physical entity. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (garnet, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of garnet? The answer is ". The answer is transparent gem, so the [MASK] is transparent gem. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (caudate nucleus, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of caudate nucleus? The answer is ". The answer is basal ganglion, so the [MASK] is basal ganglion. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
From the given examples, I see a pattern where the tail entity in the [MASK] position is the hypernym, or more general category, of the initial given entity. In the first example, "make" is a type of "modify," so "modify" is the hypernym and the correct answer. In the second example, "physical object" is a type of "physical entity," so "physical entity" is the hypernym and the correct answer. Similarly
******
Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (master of ceremonies, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of master of ceremonies? The answer is ". The answer is host, so the [MASK] is host. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (host, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of host? The answer is ". The answer is innkeeper, so the [MASK] is innkeeper. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (junket, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of junket? The answer is ". The answer is host, so the [MASK] is host. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (emcee, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of emcee? The answer is ". The answer is host, so the [MASK] is host. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the supplementary information provided in the examples, I understand that there is a relationship between the terms "master of ceremonies," "host," and "emcee," as they are derivationally related forms of one another. Additionally, "host" is a hypernym of "junket," and "innkeeper" is a hypernym of "host." These relationships may be useful in sorting the candidate answers for the goal question.
******
Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (genus caretta, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of genus caretta? The answer is ". The answer is reptile genus, so the [MASK] is reptile genus. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (hipsters, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of hipsters? The answer is ". The answer is youth subculture, so the [MASK] is youth subculture. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (piece, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of piece? The answer is ". The answer is portion, so the [MASK] is portion. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (break, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of break? The answer is ". The answer is exchange, so the [MASK] is exchange. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
From these additional examples, I see that the hypernym relationship can exist between more abstract or general terms as well, such as "genus caretta" and "reptile genus," or "piece" and "portion." These examples further illustrate the pattern of the tail entity being the more general category of the initial given entity, and they provide a broader context for the task of sorting the candidate answers for the goal question.
******
Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (innkeeper, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of innkeeper? The answer is ". The answer is host, so the [MASK] is host. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (host, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of host? The answer is ". The answer is master of ceremonies, so the [MASK] is master of ceremonies. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
These additional examples emphasize the relationship between "innkeeper," "host," and "master of ceremonies," and they show that these terms are interchangeable as derivationally related forms. This information will be helpful in sorting the candidate answers for the goal question.

The [MASK] in each of these examples can be filled with:

* minute for hr,
* serratus muscles for trunk,

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (york, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of york? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

Yes, I understand the instructions. I will carefully read and analyze the examples, trying to understand the potential meaning of the goal question and capture any supplementary information. I will summarize the way of thinking in the examples and memorize the information that I think may be helpful to the sorting task. I will remain silent during the example presentation and only output the sorted candidate answers when prompted.

Based on the examples provided, I can infer that the goal is to predict the hypernym (a word or phrase that denotes a class of things to which something belongs) of a given entity. In each example, the entity is provided, and the task is to identify its hypernym by completing the sentence with the appropriate word or phrase.

From the first example, I can see that the entity "make" has the hypernym "modify." From the second example, the entity "

Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (york, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of york? The answer is ". The answer is royalty, so the [MASK] is royalty. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the supplementary information provided, I can see that the entity "york" has the hypernym "royalty." This suggests that the entity "york" is a member of the class of things denoted by the hypernym "royalty." This is consistent with the goal of predicting the hypernym of a given entity.

I will use this information, along with the examples provided earlier, to inform my sorting of the candidate answers for the goal question.

From the analogy examples given, I can see that the task is to predict the hypernym of a given entity, using the same structure of completing the sentence "what is the hypernym of [entity]?" The answers provided in these examples suggest that the hypernyms can be a broader category that the given entity belongs to, such as "reptile genus" and "youth subculture."

These examples help me to understand that for the goal question "predict the tail

The last set of examples also helps to provide more context on what to expect when predicting the hypernyms of given entities. The answers in these examples range from more specific categories like "jelly fungus" to more general ones like "implementation" and "unconsciousness."

These examples suggest that the answers can be at different levels of abstraction and can require knowledge of various domains. Additionally, the answers can be multi-word phrases, not just single words.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers to a given goal question in order of likelihood.
******
The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (number, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of number? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Based on the examples provided, the task is to predict the hypernym of a given entity. A hypernym is a word or phrase that is more general than a specified word and that can be used as a category for it. For example, the hypernym of "make" is "modify", the hypernym of "physical object" is "physical entity", the hypernym of "garnet" is "transparent gem", and the hypernym of "caudate

Based on the supplement information examples, the task involves not only hypernym prediction but also meronym and derivationally related form prediction. A meronym is a word or phrase that is a part of another word or phrase. Derivationally related form refers to a word that is related to another word by a process of word formation. This information will help me understand the context and potential relationships among the entities, and sort the candidate answers more accurately.

These additional analogy examples show that the hypernym prediction task can involve entities from various domains, such as biology, culture, and objects, and the hypernyms can be at different levels of generality. This reinforces the importance of understanding the context and potential relationships among the entities in order to sort the candidate answers more accurately. It also suggests that the [MASK] entity can be a single word or a multi-word phrase.

These analogy examples demonstrate that the entities provided for hypernym prediction can be complex, with multiple words, and the hypernyms can also be at different levels of generality. For example, the hypernym of "jew's-ears" is "jelly fungus" which has a narrower focus as compare to the hypernym of "motorization" which is "implementation" with a broader focus.

These analogy examples demonstrate that the entities for hypernym prediction can be abstract and have complex meanings or relationships. For example, the hypernym of "puerility" is "immaturity", and the hypernym of "part to whole relation" is "semantic relation". This reinforces the need to consider the context and potential relationships among the entities to accurately sort the candidate answers. It also suggests that the [MASK] entity can be at a higher level of generality,

These analogy examples demonstrate that the entities for hypernym prediction can be composed of multiple words, and the hypernym can be more general or specific based on the entities.

From the examples, I can see that the task involves predicting the tail entity in a sentence that completes the phrase "what is the derivationally related form of [entity]?" The correct answer is provided, and it is the entity that should be placed in the [MASK] position in the sentence. The relationship between the given entity and the correct answer varies, and it seems to require some knowledge of word forms and morphology to determine the correct answer. I will keep this in mind

Based on the given examples with supplementary information, I have gathered the following insights:

* In these examples, the task is still to predict the tail entity in the given sentence.
* The key difference is that the relationship between the entities is now defined by "derivationally\_related\_form" instead of "hypernym."
* The answer for the first example is "insist," which is a derivationally\_related\_form of "insisting."

From the additional analogical examples, here are the insights I've gained:

* The task remains the same, which is to predict the tail entity of the given sentence template.
* These examples, however, focus on the relationship of "hypernym" between the entities in the sentence.
* The general approach is to understand the basic concept provided by the first entity in the given context and then predict the tail entity that could be a hypernym of the first entity.

Based on the given examples, the task requires me to predict the tail entity that completes the _member_meronym relationship with the given entity. The relationship appears to be a subclass-subtype relationship where the given entity is the superclass and the tail entity is a subtype or member of that superclass. I will use this information to sort the candidate answers for the goal question.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (field event, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of field event? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Based on the examples provided, I can observe the following pattern:

1. The goal question provides a head entity and asks for its hypernym.
2. The head entity is followed by a comma and _hypernym of, which indicates that the goal is to find the hypernym of the given entity.
3. The candidate answer is the actual hypernym of the given entity.

Using this pattern, I can summarize the way of thinking as follows:

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers to a given goal question in order of likelihood.
******
The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (watt second, _has_part of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _has_part of watt second? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.
******
Yes, I understand the goal question and the instructions for processing the given examples. I will carefully read, realize, and think about each example and summarize the way of thinking and memorize any helpful information. I will remain silent until you give the signal for me to output.

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (writings, _has_part of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _has_part of writings? The answer is ". The answer is job, so the [MASK] is job. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (ungulate, _has_part of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _has_part of ungulate? The answer is ". The answer is hock-joint, so the [MASK] is hock-joint. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (gestation period, _has_part of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _has_part of gestation period? The answer is ". The answer is trimester, so the [MASK] is trimester. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (reproduction, _has_part of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _has_part of reproduction? The answer is ". The answer is parturition, so the [MASK] is parturition. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the given examples, the goal question can be analogized as:

* The first example indicates that for the subject "_has\_part of writings", the [MASK] is filled with "job".
* The second example suggests that for the subject "_has\_part of ungulate", the [MASK] is replaces with "hock-joint".
* The third example replaces the [MASK] with "trimester" for the subject "_has\_

Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (watt second, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of watt second? The answer is ". The answer is work unit, so the [MASK] is work unit. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
From the supplementary information given in the last example, I will take note that "watt second" is a _hypernym of "work unit". This information can be helpful in understanding the context of the subject in question. However, since there is no direct analogy to be made from this example with the goal question, I will still focus primarily on the earlier examples provided.

In summary, the following way of thinking and information can be inferred from the given examples:
******
Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (tabooli, _has_part of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _has_part of tabooli? The answer is ". The answer is bulgur wheat, so the [MASK] is bulgur wheat. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (ocean liner, _has_part of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _has_part of ocean liner? The answer is ". The answer is cabin, so the [MASK] is cabin. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (thorax, _has_part of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _has_part of thorax? The answer is ". The answer is sternum, so the [MASK] is sternum. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (mediterranean sea, _has_part of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _has_part of mediterranean sea? The answer is ". The answer is aegean sea, so the [MASK] is aegean sea. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the given analogical examples, I can see that the [MASK] for the goal question can be replaced with a more specific entity or part of the subject in question. In other words, the task requires finding a specific component or instance that forms the whole subject entity. For instance:

* In the first example, the [MASK] for the subject "tabooli" is replaced with a specific ingredient, "bulgur wheat".
* The second example indicates that

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (white russia, _has_part of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _has_part of white russia? The answer is ". The answer is minsk, so the [MASK] is minsk. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (petabyte, _has_part of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _has_part of petabyte? The answer is ". The answer is terabyte, so the [MASK] is terabyte. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (squid, _has_part of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _has_part of squid?

The answer is ". The answer is riga, so the [MASK] is riga. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the given analogical examples, I can see that the [MASK] is related to the subject in question, but with a different granularity or perspective. In other words, the task requires finding an entity or part of the subject entity that is related to the given subject. For instance:

* In the first example, the [MASK] for the subject "white russia" is replaced with a specific city within the country, "minsk".
* In the

The answer is ". The answer is brake pedal, so the [MASK] is brake pedal. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the given analogical examples, I can see that the [MASK] for the goal question is related to the subject entity with a "part of" relationship, which requires identifying a component that forms the subject entity or a specific aspect of it. For instance:

* In the first example, the [MASK] for the subject "horsetail" is replaced with "strobilus", which is a component of the horsetail plant.
* In the second example

The answer is ". The answer is boeotia, so the [MASK] is boeotia. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (scotland, _has_part of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _has_part of scotland? The answer is ". The answer is lothian region, so the [MASK] is lothian region. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (cinchona, _has_part of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _has_part of cinchona? The answer is ". The answer is peruvian bark, so the [MASK] is peruvian bark. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the given analogical examples, I can observe the following pattern:

* The task requires identifying a specific entity or component that forms part of the subject entity.
* The subject entity can be a physical object, geographical region, or abstract concept.
* The [MASK] is related to the subject entity with a "part of" relationship, requiring identification of a component or aspect of the subject entity.
* The [MASK] can be a specific component, location,

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (wench, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of wench? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Yes, I understand. I will carefully read and analyze the examples provided, looking for patterns, analogies, and supplementary information that may help inform the sorting of the candidate answers for the goal question. I will remain silent during the example-giving process and only provide the sorted list of candidate answers when requested.

Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers to a given goal question in order of likelihood.

From the examples, I can see that the task is to predict the tail entity based on the given head entity and the _derivationally\_related\_form of the head entity. The examples suggest that the tail entity is often a verb form of the head entity, specifically a gerund or a verb in past tense or third person singular present tense. I will use this information to help with the sorting task.
******
Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (call out, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of call out? The answer is ". The answer is denote, so the [MASK] is denote. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (sound, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of sound?

The answer is ". The answer is denote, so the [MASK] is denote. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
The supplementary information provides additional context to the sorting task. It suggests that the head entity in the given examples (call out, sound, publicize, post) have a hypernym relationship with the head entity in the goal question (denote). This hypernym relationship implies a broader or more general concept, which could suggest that the tail entity for the goal question is also a more general concept. I will keep this information in mind as I perform the sorting task.

From the additional examples, I can see that the _derivationally\_related\_form of the head entity can result in a wide variety of tail entities, including nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Some of the examples suggest a relationship between the tail entity and the original head entity (such as registrar and record), while others do not have an obvious relationship (such as think and think). I will keep this in mind as I perform the sorting task and adjust

The supplementary information suggests that the _hypernym of the head entity in the goal question, denote, is inform. This implies that the tail entity for the goal question could be a more general concept related to informing or communication. The additional examples also show that announcer and report, which are related to denoting, can be hypernyms for denote. This suggests that the tail entity for the goal question could also be a hypernym of the head entity. I will consider both of these

From the analogy examples, I can see that the _derivationally\_related\_form of the head entity can result in tail entities that are both nouns and verbs. Some of the tail entities, like trailer, stop, and cook, are closely related to the head entity. The last example, however, shows a looser relationship between the head entity and the tail entity, with physical contact being a more general concept related to touch.

The supplementary information further confirms the relationship between denoting, denote, and announcer. This suggests that the tail entity for the goal question could be a noun related to communication or signification.

The example with cry and denote shows that denote can be a hypernym of a more concrete action like cry. This could suggest that the tail entity for the goal question could be a more abstract concept related to communication or signification.

From these examples, I can see that the _derivationally\_related\_form of the head entity can result in tail entities that are both verbs and nouns, and often the relationship between the head and tail entity is one of action and implement, like in the case of incubate and incubator.

In the example with "hold on" and "hold," the relationship between the head and tail entity is one of idiomatic usage, where one word

I have analyzed and understood the provided examples. Here's how I will approach the sorting task:

1. Identify the relationship between the given pair of entities in the goal question and the given examples. In this case, the relationship is "_derivationally_related_form of". This tells me that I am looking for a word that has a certain relationship with the given word "forgetfulness".
2. Use the given examples to infer the pattern for completing the

From the examples provided, I can see that some of the answers are not just simple variations of the given word, but rather different forms of the same concept. For instance, "registrar" and "record" share the same concept of recording information, while "soubriquet" and "nickname" have the same meaning. With this observation in mind, I will look for a word that shares a similar concept or meaning with forgetfulness, rather than a simple variation of the

I understand. Based on the examples provided, the task is to predict the hypernym of a given entity. The hypernym is a broader category or class that the given entity belongs to. In the first example, "make" is a type of "modify." In the second example, "physical object" is a type of "physical entity." In the third example, "garnet" is a type of "transparent gem." In the fourth example, "caud

Thank you for the additional information. Based on the new information provided, it seems that the task still involves predicting the hypernym of a given entity, but now the entity is "andante." Additionally, the given examples suggest that the answer to this question is "passage." I will keep this information in mind while sorting the candidate answers.

I understand. The new examples given involve entities with different levels of specificity, such as "genus caretta" (a specific type of reptile) and "hipsters" (a subculture of youth). The answers to these examples suggest that the goal is to predict a hypernym that is more general and abstract, but still accurately captures the nature of the given entity. I will take this into account while sorting the candidate answers.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (zoology, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of zoology? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Based on the given examples, I continue to summarize the approach to analogy by considering the following:

* In each example, the first entity is a specific term and the second entity is a broader category that the specific term belongs to.
* The specific term and the broad category have a generalization relationship.
* This generalization relationship is the same as the relationship between the hypernym and the given entity in the goal question.

By analogy with the previous examples, the approach to solving the goal question is as follows:

1. Analyze the given entity and determine its category. In the goal question, the given entity is "freight".

Based on the examples provided, I will look for the occupation, nationality, or role of the given entity to determine the answer to the goal question.

From these examples, I can see that the [MASK] is always a word that is derivationally related to the first entity, as indicated by the prompt "_derivationally\_related\_form of". This means that the [MASK] and the first entity share a common root word and may differ in suffixes or prefixes. I can use this information to infer possible [MASK] entities based on the derivational relationships identified in the examples given.

Based on the provided examples, in the "_derivationally\_related\_form of" relationship, the [MASK] entity is often a variation of the given entity with a common root or shared meaning. The examples suggest the following observations:

1. The given entity may have a suffix or prefix added to form the [MASK] entity, such as "stop" transforming into "stop over."
2. The given entity may have a similar meaning but be modified as a different

Understood, I will keep these additional examples in mind as well. The first example suggests that the hypernym of a specific taxonomic group such as "genus caretta" may be a more general taxonomic group such as "reptile genus".

I understand the given supplementary examples provide additional information about the word "read". The first example suggests that the derivationally related form of "recitation" is "read". The second example suggests that the hypernym of "read" is "verbalize". The third example suggests that the verb group of "read" is "read" itself. The fourth example confirms the relationship in the goal question, as the derivationally related form of "read" is "reader".

Based on the examples provided, it appears that the task is to predict the hypernym of a given entity. A hypernym is a word or phrase that is more general than the given entity and belongs to the same basic category.

Based on the additional examples provided, I now see that the task involves not only predicting the hypernym of a given entity, but also identifying derivationally related forms of a given word or phrase.

Based on these additional examples, it appears that the hypernyms of entities can span a wide range of levels of abstraction, from very specific to very general.

Based on these additional examples, it appears that the hypernyms of medical terms such as "hematemesis" and "vomiting" will likely be more specific than general categories.
