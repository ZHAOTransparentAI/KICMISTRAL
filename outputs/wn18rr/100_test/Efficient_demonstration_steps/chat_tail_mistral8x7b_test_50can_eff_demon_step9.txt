The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (trade name, _member_of_domain_usage of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _member_of_domain_usage of trade name? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (telephone, _verb_group of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _verb_group of telephone? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

Yes, I understand. I will carefully read and analyze the given examples, taking note of any patterns, relationships, or other helpful information. I will first focus on understanding the potential meaning of the goal question by analyzing similar examples. Then, I will mine supplementary information from the other examples to aid in sorting the candidate answers. I will remain silent until you signal that it is time for me to output.

Based on the provided analogy examples, I can infer that the goal question is about predicting the tail entity in a given sentence, with a focus on determining the correct _verb_group for the given subject. From the examples, I observe that the direct object of the verb group, when present, is not explicitly mentioned in the pattern, and the primary challenge lies in selecting the appropriate verb that connects the subject with the implied object. In order to sort the candidate answers for the goal question

Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (telephone, _synset_domain_topic_of of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _synset_domain_topic_of of telephone? The answer is ". The answer is telephony, so the [MASK] is telephony. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (tintinnabulation, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of tintinnabulation?

******
Based on the supplementary examples, I notice additional information that can aid in the sorting task. These examples introduce new relationships, such as _synset\_domain\_topic\_of, hypernym, and derivationally\_related\_form, which offer more context and information about the subject entity. By considering these relationships, I can better understand the subject and its potential connections to the missing verb group. In particular, it appears that the relationships provide background knowledge and clues about the subject'

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (invite, _verb_group of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _verb_group of invite? The answer is ". The answer is invite, so the [MASK] is invite. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (universally, _verb_group of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _verb_group of universally?

The answer is ". The answer is quiver, so the [MASK] is quiver. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
With the new set of analogy examples, I observe that the subject entities are simpler in nature compared to the supplementary examples. The main focus is on selecting the correct verb that completes the sentence, without the need to consider more complex subject-verb relationships. This will have an impact on how I approach the sorting task for the goal question as I'll have to weight more the semantic meaning behind the candidate answers and their relationships to the subject entity.

Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (telephony, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of telephony?

******
From the supplementary examples, I notice that words related to the telephone have a clear connection in terms of derivation, hypernym, and verb groups. This information helps establish telephone as a central concept, which I will use to guide the sorting task for the goal question. The examples demonstrate the specific connections between telephony, telephone calls, and call, all of which relate to the broader category of cell phones. Considering these relationships, I will look for candidate answers that have a strong association

******
These analogy examples reaffirm my approach for the sorting task, focusing on the verb group relationship between the given subject and candidate answer. This time, the examples show that the solution maintains the original verb in some cases, suggesting that I should consider the direct relationship between the subject and candidate answers. I'll be prepared for cases when the subject and the correct candidate answer share

The answer is ". The answer is telephone, so the [MASK] is telephone. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
With these supplementary examples, I see that the relationship between the subject and candidate answer can be multifaceted, involving derivationally\_related\_form and hypernym relationships. This will play an important role in the sorting task for the goal question, as I should be prepared to consider different types of connections between the subject and candidate answer. I will also consider candidates where the subject and answer have a direct relationship or the subject verb relationship is shared with the correct answer. In summary,

The answer is ". The answer is name, so the [MASK] is name. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
The additional analogy examples emphasize the need to consider cases where the solution involves the original verb or similar verbs with a close meaning. I should also consider verbs that indicate the action in a more generic or abstract way. This is particularly important with verbs that could have a wide range of uses and meanings. These insights will guide the sorting task for the goal question, as I will need to carefully weight the relevance of semantically similar verbs to the subject and their

The answer is ". The answer is telephoner, so the [MASK] is telephoner. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
These supplementary examples reinforce the importance of considering distinct words that share a semantic or linguistic relationship with the subject entity. In particular, the focus on derivationally\_related\_form highlights the need to identify the words that have distinct relationships based on their meanings or structure. While sorting the candidate answers for the goal question I will pay attention to different types of connections for the candidate answers and the given subject, giving preference to those that better reflect a direct or meaningful relationship.

******
The new analogy examples highlight cases where the solution includes a verb that has a meaning related to the original subject or adds a layer of meaning. In some cases, the verb group is directly linked to the subject, while in other cases, a different verb group is used to better describe the subject's context or intended meaning.

These insights will be helpful when sorting the candidate answers, as I'll take into account the degree of synonymy, semantic proximity, and

The provided examples demonstrate the cases where the solution involves a more complex verb group relationship with the subject, updating the subject's meaning or context. This may include cases where the verb group has a strong connection with the subject, even when the verb group doesn't necessarily convey a surprising or unexpected meaning.

Considering these examples, I should carefully analyze the verb groups in each candidate answer. When sorting the candidate answers for the goal question, I will focus on the semantic relationship

These examples emphasize the direct relationship between the subject entity and the correct verb group. The solution will prioritize cases where the verb group has a direct semantic relationship with the subject, as its meaning aligns with the subject itself. This serves as a confirmation of the previous insights; I will continue to focus on the semantic relationship between the subject and verb group when sorting the candidate answers.

After thoroughly analyzing the analogy examples provided, my understanding is more comprehensive and focused, allowing me to account for cases where the relationship between the subject and the verb group can be straightforward as well as more complex.

Sorting the candidate answers involves paying close attention to any type of semantic relationship existing between the subject and the verb group.

Based on the examples provided, it appears that the goal question is asking me to identify the hypernym, or more general category, for a given entity. In the first example, the entity "make" is determined to have the hypernym "modify" because to "make" something often involves modifying existing materials or processes. In the second example, the entity "physical object" has the hypernym "physical entity," because a physical object is a type of physical entity that has

Based on the additional examples provided, I can see that the hypernym of a given entity can vary depending on the specific context and level of abstraction. For instance, the hypernym of "genus caretta" is "reptile genus," which indicates its position in the taxonomic hierarchy. Meanwhile, the hypernym of "hipsters" is "youth subculture," situating it within a social and cultural framework. These examples further confirm my understanding of the goal

I have analyzed the given examples and inferred that determining the hypernym of a particular entity involves identifying a higher level concept or category to which it belongs. For example, the hypernym of "puerility" is "immaturity," as "puerility" is a specific type of "immaturity." Similarly, the hypernym of "part to whole relation" is "semantic relation" because "part to whole relation" is a subset of "semantic relation."

I have studied the additional examples and observed that the process of identifying the hypernym of a given entity involves determining a broader category or concept that encompasses the specific entity.

In the case of "collage film," the hypernym is "picture show" because a collage film is a type of show or presentation. Similarly, for "fisherman's lure," the hypernym is "lure" given that it is a type of device used to attract fish.

******
Based on the given examples, I will attempt to analogize and understand the potential meaning of the goal question. Here is a summary of my thinking process:

1. The goal question is asking for the hypernym of a given entity (in this case, "surface").
2. A hypernym is a word or phrase that denotes a category or class to which something belongs.
3. The given examples provide several cases where the tail entity is a hypernym of the surface entity.

******
Continuing from my previous analysis, I will now consider the supplementary information given in the examples:

1. The first example mentions that the hypernym of "roof of the mouth" is "surface".
2. The second and fourth examples mention that the derivationally\_related\_form of "surface" is "surface" itself.
3. The third example mentions that the hypernym of "hard palate" is also "surface".

Based on these additional examples, I will further summarize and memorize the following general patterns to help with the sorting task:

1. In most cases, the tail entity is a more general or abstract category, which encompasses the given entity.
2. A hypernym of a given entity typically refers to a broader category or class to which the entity belongs, while a derivationally\_related\_form represents a related form of the given entity.

******
Upon analyzing the supplementary information given in these examples, I can further summarize and memorize the following insights:

1. The given examples suggest that "end", "side", and "welkin" are also assigned the hypernym "surface".
2. This indicates that the hypernym "surface" may have a broader meaning than initially anticipated.
3. I will consider whether the term "surface" can cover various aspects or types of surfaces, including physical and abstract

******
Based on these additional examples, I will further analyze the general patterns:

1. The provided examples show that hypernyms can be linked to the given entities through different levels of specificity, from more specific categories to more general ones.
2. The entity "surface" has a broader meaning, as it can cover various aspects or types of surfaces, including physical and abstract.

Moving forward, I will assimilate this knowledge and use it to better sort the candidate answers

******
I will analyze these examples to enhance my comprehension and determine the best way to sort the candidate answers:

1. In the first example, the hypernym of "puerility" is "immaturity", which suggests that hypernyms can be connected to the given entities by increasing the level of abstraction or generality.
2. The second example introduces a more complex relationship, where the hypernym for "part to whole relation" is "semantic relation".

The answer is ". The answer is railway locomotive, so the [MASK] is railway locomotive. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Upon examining these examples more closely, I will continue my analysis to better understand the relationships and fine-tune my sorting approach:

1. For "collage film", the hypernym of "picture show" is a broader category than "collage film".
2. In the case of "fisherman's lure", the hypernym "lure" is less specific than "fisherman's lure".
3. For "yelling",

To grasp the general patterns more accurately, I will consider the implications of these additional examples:

1. "Sorrow" is given the hypernym "unhappiness", increasing the level of abstraction.
2. "Muharram" is associated with the more general term "islamic calendar month".
3. "Subcontract" has the hypernym "hire", further emphasizing the importance of understanding various levels of specificity and generalization.

To wrap up my analysis of the given examples, I should consider the following general patterns:

1. In some instances, the given entity is linked with a more specific hypernym, like the case with "abortionist" and "physician".
2. Occasionally, the hypernyms are less straightforward, like the example with "suspect" and "venture". It's important to be aware of potential challenges and consider multiple perspectives.

Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I understand that my role is to perform link prediction and sort a given list of candidate answers in order of likelihood, with the most probable answers appearing first. I will strive to provide a helpful and accurate response.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (ski, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of ski? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Based on the provided examples, I will use analogy to infer that the task of completing the given sentence by predicting the hypernym of a given entity involves understanding the relationship between the given entity and a broader concept to which it belongs. The answers in the examples suggest that the [MASK] in the goal question should be the broader concept or category to which the entity "ski" belongs.

I will also keep in mind the examples that involve using multiple levels of sub-categories or hyper

Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (ski, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of ski? The answer is ". The answer is skiing, so the [MASK] is skiing. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (water ski, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of water ski? The answer is ". The answer is ski, so the [MASK] is ski. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (skiing, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of skiing?

The answer is ". The answer is sport, so the [MASK] is sport. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
From the supplementary information, I will keep in mind that the concept of deriving a word and finding the hypernym or domain topic of a word can be useful in defining the context to which the entity belongs.

Additionally, I will note that the answers in the supplementary examples suggest a potential link between the entity "ski" and the category "sport". This information might potentially assist in the sorting of the candidate answers to the goal question.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I understand that my role is to perform link prediction and sort a given list of candidate answers in order of likelihood, with the most probable answers appearing first. I will strive to provide a helpful and accurate response.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (time to come, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of time to come? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Yes, I understand the instructions. I will carefully read, realize, and think about the examples before I begin the sorting task. I will summarize the potential meaning of the goal question through analogy and mine the potential relationships among the given facts for supplementary information. Once I have a clear understanding of the task, I will begin sorting the candidate answers.

Understood. From the given examples, I can see that the goal question is asking for a hypernym or a broader category term for the given entity. I will use this analogy to understand the goal question and apply it to sort the candidate answers accordingly. The provided examples also indicate that the answer will be a single word. I will keep this in mind during the sorting process.

Additionally, the given facts contain supplementary information about the hierarchy and relationships between the terms, such

Thank you for providing more information. This supplemental information indicates that there is a direct relationship between the terms time to come and future, and that they are derivationally related forms of each other. This suggests that the answer to the goal question may be related to the concept of time.

Additionally, the task requires finding a hypernym for the given entity, which suggests that the answer is at a higher level of abstraction than the entity itself. With this information in mind,

Understood, from these examples, I can see that the answers are single words, often compound nouns, that represent a higher level of abstraction than the given entities.

The entities are all different, ranging from animals, subcultures, objects, and actions, and the answers are representative of these categories. I will use this information to guide my sorting task for the goal question.

The new example confirms the connection between "evidence" and "manifest":

* "evidence" and "manifest" are derivationally\_related\_form pairs.

With this information, we can further strengthen the connection between "evidence" and the other related terms observed in the previous examples. This will help us better predict the likely hypernyms for the goal question.

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (record, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of record? The answer is ". The answer is registrar, so the [MASK] is registrar. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (recidivism, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of recidivism? The answer is ".

From these additional analogy examples, I can see the relationship between the given word and the answer for the "derivationally\_related\_form" can be more complex and diverse than what I've initially thought. For instance, in the second example, the answer "retrogress" is a verb that provides an opposite sense of the "recidivism" noun, instead of a more direct relationship like "registrar" to "record." And the final example shows

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (trail, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of trail?

The answer is ". The answer is physical contact, so the [MASK] is physical contact. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on these examples, I can see that the relationship between the word and the answer for "derivationally\_related\_form" can sometimes be a direct variation of the word itself, as shown in the "stop," "cook," and "trail" examples. However, in the case of "touch," the answer "physical contact" suggests a more indirect relationship.

I'll keep these cases in mind as I process the information and prepare to sort the candidate answers

Based on these additional examples, I understand that in some cases, the "derivationally\_related\_form" may involve a variation on the word's meaning or a closely related word of a similar family. The relationship can be indirect or multifaceted.

With these in mind, I am now prepared to process the given supplementary information and then rank the candidate answers for the goal question.

From the examples you have given, I understand that for the derivationally\_related\_form, the answer can be a word that is:

* A close synonym or related term (mixture to unify)
* The same word (bed, weeping, cry, notch)

Based on this understanding, I can move on to sort the candidate answers for the main question accordingly.

I will use these additional examples to further refine my understanding of the sorting task.

* In some cases, the _derivationally\_related\_form_ may involve a noun or participle form of the original verb (thought to think)
* There could also be more complex relationships where the answer is an unconventional derivative (vitality to stimulate)
* Sometimes, the answer may be a descriptive word associated with the original term

In those examples given, I noticed some interesting patterns:

* The relationship between the input and the answer may suggest a new word that can represent the same concept or a verb with a similar meaning (snatch to take hold of, stylize to vogue, ostracism to ostracize)
* Sometimes, there could be a direct relationship between the input and the answer if the input is already a valid word (register)

Based on the previous examples, some insights to consider when predicting the [MASK] entity are:

1. _Hypernym_ relationships can be of various levels of abstraction, meaning that the [MASK] entity can be a domain-specific term, a general class, or a higher-order category.
2. When providing an answer, it's essential to capture the context and the nuance of the second entity.

From the given examples, I observe a few patterns:

1. The _hypernym of_ relationship generally denotes a higher class or hierarchical level or a broader category for the second entity.

Yes, I understand. I will carefully read and consider the examples you provide, using them to inform my understanding of the potential meaning and relationships relevant to the goal question. I will not output any responses until you indicate that I should do so. I will focus on summarizing the patterns and relationships in the examples and retaining any useful information for the sorting task.

Based on the provided examples, I observe that the pattern is to predict the tail entity that completes the relationship specified by the given entity and relationship. In each of the examples, the tail entity is a subcategory of the given entity. Therefore, to sort the candidate answers for the goal question, I will apply this pattern and look for the tail entity that is a subcategory of subclass crossopterygii.

Furthermore, although not explicitly stated in the examples, I

Based on the supplementary information provided, I now have additional context to inform my understanding of the relationships between the entities. In particular, the relation between osteichthyes and subclass crossopterygii shows that subclass crossopterygii is a subcategory of osteichthyes. This information, combined with the pattern I identified earlier, suggests that to sort the candidate answers for the goal question, I should prioritize entities that are subcategories of subclass crossopterygii

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I understand that my role is to perform link prediction and sort a given list of candidate answers in order of likelihood, with the most probable answers appearing first. I will strive to provide a helpful and accurate response.
******
The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (ulmus carpinifolia, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of ulmus carpinifolia? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

The answer is modify, so the [MASK] is modify. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (physical object, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of physical object?

******
From the examples, I can identify a pattern in which the [MASK] entity is a more general category or hypernym for the given entity. For example, the hypernym of "garnet" is "transparent gem", and the hypernym of "make" is "modify". This pattern will help me in sorting the candidate answers for the goal question. Additionally, I will also consider any supplementary information provided as potential clues or relationships.

Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (ulmus, _member_meronym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _member_meronym of ulmus? The answer is ". The answer is ulmus carpinifolia, so the [MASK] is ulmus carpinifolia. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
The supplementary information from the examples indicates that the relationship between "ulmus" and "ulmus carpinifolia" is one of _member_meronym, meaning that "ulmus carpinifolia" is a member or part of the "ulmus" genus. This information helps me to understand the context and relationships that may exist for the goal question. I will use this knowledge to help me sort the candidate answers.

Based on the provided examples, I understand that the goal is to predict the hypernym of a given entity. The examples illustrate various types of entities, including processes (make, modify), physical objects (physical object, physical entity), and specific objects (garnet, transparent gem) as well as a biological structure (caudate nucleus, basal ganglion). The task is to infer a more general category for each entity and rank the answers accordingly. I will apply this

Based on the additional example and the information it provides, I will consider the relation "has\_part" as a potentially useful clue in my analysis. The given example shows that "track meet" has "field event" as a part.

I have carefully analyzed the additional examples, taking into account the diverse range of entities and the varied relationships between them. From these examples, I have noted the progression from specific terms, such as "jew's-ears" and "hydrogen carbonate," to more general categories, such as "jelly fungus" and "carbonate." This confirms the need to identify the right level of generalization in the answers provided in order to successfully fulfill the task

The answer is ". The answer is performance, so the [MASK] is performance. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
I have examined the latest set of examples which further demonstrate the range of possible entities and the relationships between them. The task requires considering the specific context of each entity and understanding the appropriate level of generalization. For instance, moving from the concept of a "part to whole relation" to a more general "semantic relation" indicates the importance of grasping the underlying concepts and the relationships they entail. This process allows for informed judgement in organizing the candidate answers in a meaningful way that align

I have analyzed the final set of examples, which showcase even more specific instances of entities and their relationships to broader categories. These examples underline the necessity of a deep understanding of the contexts presented and the ability to accurately determine the relevant links between entities and their hypernyms.

For instance, in the case of a "fisherman's lure" being a more specialized type of "lure," the ability to distinguish such relationships is crucial in the accurate determination of hyper

I have carefully review the complete list of examples provided and they have helped me understand the diverse range of entities and relationships between them. Understanding the differences between heightened emotional states like "sorrow" and its broader category "unhappiness" as well as specialized concepts like "subcontract" belonging to a "hire" and the specific "parallelize" function being a member of the "set" family, I am now better prepared to identify the right level of generalization for the candidate

I have thoroughly examined and internalized the given examples, which cover a wide variety of entities, some with specialized meanings, and others with more general connotations. Examples such as "abortions" falling under the broad hypernym "physician," "suspects" as a type of "venture," "towers" being a kind of "structure," and "ecclesiastical benefices" forming part of a "spirituality" all serve to highlight

I have taken note of the examples provided and considered their underlying relationships. These examples demonstrate how various entities can fit into broader categories:

* "Dita bark" as a member of the "tree" family, demonstrating the progression from a specific item to a general category.
* "Modernize" as a sub-type of "change," illustrating that sometimes multiple levels of generalization can be involved.
* "Textual criticism" as a specialized sub-field

I will continue to keep the examples in mind and analyze the patterns in relationships. These examples further reveal the relationships between entities:

* "Freeze" as a specific instance of being "put under" a condition.
* The abstraction of the quality "expensiveness" being a specific manifestation of the more general "price."
* The royal "Saxe-Coburg-Gotha" family belonging to the broader concept of "royalty."

I have committed the examples to memory and analyzed the connections between entities:

Based on the given examples, I will look for the hypernym (a word or phrase that has a broad meaning that encompasses a group of smaller more specific meanings) of "get out".

Therefore, I will look for a word that categorizes "get out" in a broad sense. In this case, I will focus on the verb form of "get

Based on the previous examples, I can see that the hypernym of the given entity is related to the general category or the broader classification of the entity. In the last example, "break" is related to the exchange as break can be considered as a type of exchange. With this understanding, in my sorting task, I will look for a word that categorizes "get out" in a broad sense. I already know that the relationship between the given entities is "hypernym of" so

I will keep in mind that the relationship between the given entities in the analogous examples is "hypernym of", indicating that the candidate answer is a more general category encompassing the given entity.

I will also note that in some cases, the relationship between the given entity and the candidate answer is not strictly a hypernym/hyponym relationship, but rather a broader relationship of categorization. For example, "neomycin" is a specific type of "antibiotic drug", and "trick" can be a type of "performance". This understanding will help me recognize a wider range of relevant relationships beyond the strict definition of hypernymy.

From these examples, I will also note that the hypernym of a given entity can be a verbal or nominal noun, depending on the context. For example, "subcontract" is a noun, but its hypernym is the verb "hire". Similarly, "parallelize" is a verb, but its hypernym is the verbal noun "set".

From these supplementary examples, I can see that there can be multiple valid relationships between the given word and the tail entity, including synonyms, hypernyms (more general than the given word), and related concepts.

From these examples, I can see that the tail entity can be a noun or adjective form of the given word, or it can be a word that is closely related to the meaning of the given word, such as a synonym or hyponym.

From this additional example, I can see that the relationship between the given word and the tail entity can also be that of a derivational form, where the tail entity is formed by adding a derivational morpheme to the given word.

I understand that the goal is to predict the tail entity of the relation "_derivationally_related_form of" given a head entity, by analyzing the given examples, I observed the following:

* The tail entity is a verb or a gerund related to the head entity
* The tail entity can be an action performed on the head entity or a transformation

I have analyzed the additional examples and noted that the head entity has a hypernym relationship with the tail entity. I understand that in this task, I should consider the head entity as a candidate for the tail entity if the tail entity is a hypernym of the head entity. In this case, the word "denote" appears as the hypernym for the given head entities, which indicates that the tail entity is likely to be "denote" for this particular task. I will keep this information

I have noted that the tail entities in these examples are not always verbs, but can be nouns that are derived from the head entities. These tail entities can also be synonyms or near-synonyms of the head entities. I recognize that the pattern of the tail entity being the same as the head entity can also occur. I will take all of these patterns into account when completing the sorting task.

After analyzing the new examples, I have determined that the word "denote" can be a hypernym of the head entities "denote" and "report". In addition, the word "announcer" is a derivationally related form of the head entity "denote", and the tail entity is "denote". These relationships will be taken into account when sorting the candidate answers for the goal question.

After analyzing the analogous examples, I understand that the tail entity in these cases may be related to the head entity through a variety of relationships, such as being a derivationally related form with the same spelling, a root form, or a form indicating a similar meaning. I will keep this in mind while sorting the candidate answers for the goal question.

Understood, I have taken note of the additional examples. I will consider the relationship between the head and tail entities as a derivationally related form, where the tail entity could be a form of the head entity or related to the head entity in some way. This will be used to guide my sorting of the candidate answers for the main question.

I understand. The similar examples illustrate the relationship between the head and tail entities where the tail entity is a verb and the head entity is a noun, which is derivationally related to the tail entity. In these examples, the tail entity can be obtained by adding an affix, such as `-ize`, to the head entity. However, this might not always be the case and the tail entity might also be a synonym to the head entity. I will keep this in mind

Understood. The analogy examples show that the head entity and tail entity are related through a derivationally-related form relationship, and the tail entity can be obtained by applying affixes or by identifying related concepts. Additionally, the supplementary examples demonstrate that the tail entity can also be a hypernym of the head entity. These insights will be used to inform the analysis of the main question.

Understood, I will keep these examples in mind when completing the sorting task. The task seems to require an understanding of the derivationally related form of a word and its hypernyms or related entities. The examples suggest that the tail entity is either a verb form of the head entity or a concept related to it. I will use this information and the previously given examples to guide my sorting decisions.

Understood. As I analyze the additional examples, I notice that the relation between the given term and the tail entity varies in nature.

In the case of "unify," the tail entity is a noun indicating a mixture or assemblage of things, indicating that the relation is one of actions and their results.

For "bed," the tail entity is a reflexive pronoun referring to the subject, so it shares the same meaning as the original term.

Thank you for providing the additional examples. I will carefully consider them as I work on the link prediction and sorting task.

Based on the additional examples, it appears that the hypernym of an entity may be a more general concept or category that includes the entity and other related concepts. For example, the hypernym of "nationality" may be a more general category of social groups or communities that includes "nationality" and other similar entities.

From the given examples, I can see that the task is to predict the hypernym of a given entity. In each example, the tail entity completion of the masked hypernym is consistent with the given answer. This task requires understanding the given entities and recognizing their hierarchical relationships in order to accurately sort the candidate answers.

Based on the examples, I will extract the following key points to guide my thinking:

Based on the pattern demonstrated in the examples, it appears that the "hypernym" refers to a more general or broader category that includes the given entity. The hypernym can be found by considering the different characteristics, properties, or functions of the given entity and then identifying a more general concept that encompasses it. Understanding the context, and using common sense knowledge and background information, can be helpful in determining the correct hypernym for the given entity.

Thank you for providing the examples. Based on these examples, I can see that the task is to predict the hypernym of a given entity. A hypernym is a genus or general category that includes the entity as one of its species or subcategories. Therefore, the answer to the question "what is the hypernym of [entity]?" should be a more general category that includes the [entity] as one of its subcategories.

Based on the given examples, I can see a pattern in the relationships between the entities. The second entity in the tuples with "_derivationally\_related\_form of" relates to the first entity in a way that the first entity is usually a more specialized term, and the second entity is a generalized or root form. The second entity can be a verb or a noun. In the example with the "_hypernym of" relationship, the first entity is a specialization

Based on the additional examples, I notice that the relation between the first and second entity in the tuple is not always symmetrical. For instance, in the example (record, derivationally\_related\_form of, registrar), the relation is not reciprocal as record is not the derivationally\_related\_form of registrar.

Furthermore, the directionality of the relation can influence the order of the entities in the tuple, with the more dominant or important

The new examples suggest that the relationship between the first and second entities in the tuple is not always a direct derivational relationship, but can also be an action or a result of the action. For instance, in the example (stop over, derivationally\_related\_form of, stop), the second entity is actually a verb that is a part of the first entity.

I see that there has been a pattern emerging in the examples provided so far. From the first set of examples, I noticed that the second entity in the tuple is generally a more generalized concept compared to the first entity, with a relation of a specialized term to a generalized term in the Example 1, Example 3, and Example 4. However, the reverse is true in Example 2, where the second entity in the tuple is a specifically related term to the first entity,

I notice that there are instances where the derivationally\_related\_form of a word is the same as the word itself, as in the first and fourth examples (structure and relate).

From the provided examples, it seems that the task is to identify the relationship between the first entity and the second entity and apply the same relationship to predict the missing entity.

From these examples, I see that I am being asked to predict the domain or topic of the given entity by filling in the [MASK] in the sentence. I will use the given entity "culpable negligence" and the relation "_synset\_domain\_topic\_of" to determine the most likely domain or topic for this entity. The examples suggest that there may be specific domains or topics that are commonly associated with certain entities, such as "atom" with "chemistry"

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I understand that my role is to perform link prediction and sort a given list of candidate answers in order of likelihood, with the most probable answers appearing first. I will strive to provide a helpful and accurate response.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (take, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _also_see of take? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

From the given examples, I can see that the task involves predicting the tail entity in a sentence with the format "what is the _also_see of [entity]? The answer is [target entity]". The target entity seems to be related to the given entity in some way, and the clues to predict it are found in the word before the underlined _also_see of. In the first example, "fat" is related to "rounded", as being a

The answer is ". The answer is purchase, so the [MASK] is purchase. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
From the given examples, I can see that the task can involve different relationships between the given entity and the target entity, as denoted by the words before the underline. For instance, in the first example, the relationship is denoted by "synset\_domain\_topic\_of", meaning the target entity is related to the domain topic of the given entity. In the second example, the relationship is denoted by "hypernym", signifying that the target entity is a more general concept than the given

******
From the given examples, I can notice that there are different relationships between the given entity and the target entity, as shown by the words before the "_also\_see of". For example, in the first example, the relationship is denoted by "also\_see", and the target entity is a synonym or near-synonym of the given entity. In the second example, the relationship is denoted by "has context", and the target entity represents a concept that can be related to the given entity

From the given examples, I can see that the relationship between the given entity and the target entity is ambiguous and might be a synonym, antonym, or conceptually related, as indicated by the word before "_also\_see of". The answer could be derived from context clues, 	extit{a priori} knowledge, or the natural language processing model's internal knowledge base.

For instance, in the first example, the 	extit{a

******
Based on the given examples, I can observe that the relationship between the given entity and target entity is not necessarily a direct link or a hypernym. The connection could be a conceptual relationship, such as the opposite meaning, a similar meaning, or related to the given entity.

In the first example, "inconclusive" is related to "undetermined" through the association of having an uncertain outcome. In the second example, "moral" is related to "good

The answer is ". The answer is true, so the [MASK] is true. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
From the given examples, I can see that the relationship between the given entity and the target entity is not necessarily a direct relationship or a specific type of relationship. Instead, the relationship might be based on context clues, semantics, or direct or indirect association.

For instance, in the first example, "repose" is associated with "rest on" through the idea of something providing support or being supported. In the second example, "unconscious" is associated with "un

The answer is ". The answer is valuable, so the [MASK] is valuable. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
I have carefully reviewed the given examples, and I've noted that the relationship between the given entity and the target entity can be established through a variety of semantic and associative relationships, including synonymy, antonymy, complementation, collocation, and causality.

For instance, in the first example, "courageous" and "bold" both convey a sense of bravery, and they can be considered synonymous in some contexts. In the

The answer is ". The answer is honourable, so the [MASK] is honourable. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the given examples, I can see that the relationship between the given entity and the target entity can be indirect and complex, involving various associative and semantic relationships.

For instance, in the first example, "hurtle" is related to "drop anchor" through the association of swift motion and sudden stopping. In the second example, "independent" is associated with "separate" through the idea of being distinct or isolated.

In the third example, "

******
I have carefully reviewed the additional examples and I can see that the relationship between the given entity and the target entity can be based on various associative and semantic relationships, such as antonymy, hyponymy, hypernymy, synonymy, and collocation. The target entity might be related to the given entity through meaning, usage, or a specific context.

For instance, in the first example "same" and "equal" have a synonym relationship.

I will not output any answer yet, but I will continue to review the examples and their respective relationships.

For instance, in the first example "virtuous" and "chaste" share a hyponymy relationship. In the second example "rough" and "unsubdivided" have a metaphorical relationship. In the third example "easy" and "soft" have a collocation relationship. In the fourth example "comprehensible" and "clear"

Based on the previous examples, the relationship between the given entity and the tail entity can vary greatly, including synonymy, antonymy, metaphorical relationships, or other associations.

For instance, "eat" and "polish off" share a similar meaning, while "joyous" and "regimentation" have a metaphorical relationship, where the latter is a possible cause of the former. "Flare" and "flare" have the same
