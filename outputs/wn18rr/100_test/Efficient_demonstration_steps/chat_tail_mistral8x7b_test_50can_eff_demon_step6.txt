The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (trade name, _member_of_domain_usage of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _member_of_domain_usage of trade name? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Based on the provided supplementary information, I summarize the following for my sorting task:

1. The _synset\_domain\_topic\_of, derivationally\_related\_form, hypernym_ are relations from WordNet, providing additional context for understanding the relationship between entities.
2. The first supplementary example indicates that the relationship between the subject (telephone) and the [MASK] entity in the sentence is _synset\_domain\_topic\_of and

The analogy examples suggest that when the sentence contains a subject followed by a _verb\_group, the [MASK] entity should match the _verb\_group.

I will use this understanding for sorting candidate answers, aiming to find the most suitable _verb\_group for the given subject.

These supplementary examples provide additional information on the relations from WordNet, such as _derivationally\_related\_form and _hypernym. The examples demonstrate how these relations can link various entities with _telephone_ or the verb _telephone_.

For sorting, I will keep this information in mind to help make decisions based on the given example sentence and the relations presented in the following format: _verb\_group of.

******
In these cases, the _verb\_group does not alter the original verb in the sentence, and the answer matches the [MASK] entity. Thus, I will apply this logic to my sorting task, considering that for the given subject, the [MASK] entity should correspond to the _verb\_group of the completed sentence in the this format: "what is the _verb\_group of [subject]?"

These supplementary examples provide more context on the relations _derivationally\_related\_form_ and _hypernym_ using the word _telephone_ or related entities.

For the sorting task, I will continue to consider my previous findings, focusing on the sentence format "what is the _verb\_group of [subject]?" in order to make an accurate choice for the [MASK] entity.

******
These new analogy examples suggest that the [MASK] entity should match the original verb in the provided examples. This means that if the verb_group is the same as the verb in the given sentence, the [MASK] entity will be that verb.

Now I have more information to help me choose the appropriate [MASK] entity for my sorting task. I will focus on identifying the correct match between the _verb\_group and the verbs provided in the example sentences in the format

These supplementary examples further illustrate the relation _derivationally\_related\_form_ between _telephone_ and the derived words _telephone set_ and _telephoner_. This reaffirms my previous understanding of the relation between _telephone_ and other entities associated through this WordNet relation.

My primary focus for the sorting task remains unchanged, and I will continue to analyze the _verb\_group of [subject]_ format to make the

These analogy examples suggest a more complex relationship between the original verb and the _verb\_group\_of [subject]_. In some cases, the answer matches the original verb, while in others, the [MASK] entity takes on a specific phrasal verb with a similar meaning but a slightly different expression.

For my sorting task, I will keep this additional information in mind, looking carefully at the format _verb\_group of [subject]_ to match the [MASK]

In some cases, the _verb\_group of [subject]_ analogy examples reveal that the [MASK] entity is not just the original verb, but sometimes a phrasal verb or an adverb with a meaning connected to the original verb.

I will consider these finds as I approach the sorting task, taking a closer look at the format _verb\_group of [subject]_ to identify the most suitable [MASK] entity.

These examples suggest that in some instances, the [MASK] entity matches the original verb in the _verb\_group of [subject]_ construct. These instances are helpful to reaffirm my understanding of the relation between verbs and their verb groups.

Now, I have a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between original verbs and verb groups, which I will apply in my sorting task. I will continue to look closely at the format _verb\_group of [subject]_

The additional examples show that in some cases, the [MASK] entity matches the original verb group, while in others, it might be a verb that would require the input word to act as a trigger phrase.

Based on the provided examples, I can see that the goal question is asking me to predict the hypernym, or more general category, of the given entity (phylum Entoprocta). In each of the examples, the hypernym is provided as the answer to the question. I can also see that the tail entity in the masked position is always the same as the hypernym provided as the answer. This suggests that I will need to provide the hypernym of phylum

From this additional example, I can see that the tail entity in the masked position is not always the same as the answer to the question. In this case, the answer to the question is "phylum Entoprocta", but the tail entity is not explicitly stated as "phylum Entoprocta". Rather, it is the meronym, or part, of phylum Entoprocta. This suggests that I will need to carefully consider the given

From the examples, I can see that the goal is to predict the hypernym of the given entity. The hypernym is a word that is more general and applies to the given entity. In the first example, "make" is a more specific type of "modify", so "modify" is the hypernym. In the second example, "physical object" is a type of "physical entity", so "physical entity" is the hypernym. In the third example

From the examples with supplementary information, I can see that "position" is a frequently occurring hypernym and derivationally related form. This suggests that "position" may be the hypernym of the given entity in the goal question. The fact that "position" is both a hypernym and a derivationally related form suggests that "position" is a more general term that is closely related to the given entity. For example, "station" and "setting" both have hypernym "

From these examples, I can see that the [MASK] entity can sometimes be the opposite or antonym of the given entity, that the [MASK] entity can sometimes be a device or tool related to the given entity, and that the [MASK] entity can sometimes be the ability or skill related to the given entity. These patterns will help me in sorting the candidate answers for the goal question.

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (writings, _has_part of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _has_part of writings? The answer is ". The answer is job, so the [MASK] is job. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (ungulate, _has_part of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _has_part of ungulate? The answer is ". The answer is hock-joint, so the [MASK] is hock-joint. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (gestation period, _has_part of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _has_part of gestation period?

The answer is ". The answer is parturition, so the [MASK] is parturition. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
From the examples, I can see that the task involves predicting the tail entity of a given relationship by completing the sentence in a given format. The relationship is always "_has\_part of" in the examples. The answers to the questions are all parts of a larger whole, such as jobs being part of writings, and trimesters being part of gestation periods. This suggests that the tail entity in the goal question will also be a part of the entity given in the relationship.

******
From the additional examples, I see that the tail entities for the relationship "_has\_part of" can be smaller structures or components that are part of a chromosome. These include kinetochores, nucleolus organizers, and genes. This further supports my earlier understanding that the goal question is asking for a part of a chromosome. The fact that the relationship "_hypernym of" is also included in the examples and is defined as "body" suggests that there may be

From the additional examples, it's clear that the relationship "has\_part of" can apply to a wide range of entities, including foods like tabooli, transportation like ocean liners, and body parts like thorax. The tail entities in these examples are all specific components or sub-structures that are part of the larger entity. This further supports my earlier understanding that the goal question is asking for a component or part of a chromosome. Additionally, the fact that the

The answer is ". The answer is chromosome, so the [MASK] is chromosome. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
From these additional examples, it's clear that chromosomes can be part of a nucleus and that sex chromosomes are a type of chromosome. This provides further context for the goal question and suggests that the tail entity for a chromosome in the "_has\_part of" relationship is likely to be a specific component or sub-structure of a chromosome. This is consistent with my earlier understanding of the goal question.

Yes. I understand that my role is to perform link prediction and sort a given list of candidate answers in order of likelihood, with the most probable answers appearing first. I will strive to provide a helpful and accurate response.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (surface, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of surface? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.

Yes, I understand the instructions. I will carefully read and analyze the examples, looking for patterns or relationships that may help me with the sorting task. I will summarize the examples in my mind and hold onto any relevant information that may be useful for determining the hypernym of "surface." I will remain silent and await further instructions before providing my sorted list.

I understand the examples provided, and I will use them to inform my sorting of the candidate answers. Based on the analogy of these examples, I will look for the candidate answers that represent the hypernym of "surface." From the given examples, I have summarized that the hypernym of an object refers to the broader category or classification that the given object belongs to.

For instance, in the example where the goal is to predict the hypernym of "make," the example answers

Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (roof of the mouth, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of roof of the mouth?

******
I understand that the examples provided also give supplementary information.

From the second and fourth examples, I have summarized that "surface" is a derivationally related form of itself. This means that "surface" is a self-related word, and its hypernym is still itself.

In the third example, the hypernym of the "hard palate" is also "surface." This suggests that the "hard palate" is a specific type of "surface."

Based on the additional examples, I have gathered more information that will help with the sorting task. The first example indicates that the hypernym of a specific genus of sea turtles (genus caretta) is a category of animal called the "reptile genus." This suggests that the hypernym refers to a broader category that the given object belongs to.

The second example suggests that a "youth subculture" is the hypernym of "hipsters," a specific

The answer is surface, so the [MASK] is surface. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (welkin, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of welkin?

******
The examples provided also demonstrate that the "surface" is the hypernym of many other objects, such as the end, the side, and the welkin. Therefore, I will remember that objects that are parts or components of a surface may have the surface as their hypernym.

With this information, I will sort the candidate answers by looking for the objects that belong to the broader category of "surface."

Furthermore, I will keep in mind that the hypernym of

I understand that in the last set of examples, the hypernym refers to the broader category of the given term.

For example, in the first example, "puerility" is a type of "immaturity," and in the second example, "part to whole relation" is a type of "semantic relation." Similarly, in the third example, "neomycin" is a type of "antibiotic drug," and in the fourth example, "trick

Based on the supplementary information provided, I can see that there is a derivational relationship between the entities "accentuation" and "stress." This suggests that "stress" is a related concept to "accentuation."

This information may be helpful in sorting the list of candidate answers, as I can use it to consider the relationships between the entities and look for the most appropriate hypernym. I will take this into account as I perform the sorting task.

Based on these additional examples, I can see that the task of predicting the hypernym of a given entity involves finding a more general category that the entity belongs to. The examples cover a range of different types of entities, from scientific categories like "genus caretta" to more abstract concepts like "break."

This pattern suggests that I should look for a general category that "accentuation" fits into when considering the goal question. I will take this approach as I sort the list

Thank you for providing the examples. I will use these as a basis for analogy in order to sort the candidate answers for the given goal question.

From the first example, I see that the pattern is to take the given entity, in this case "set up," and find its derivationally related form, which is "effect." This tells me that the task is to identify words that are semantically or etymologically related, likely with a discernible pattern.

Thank you for providing the additional examples.

From the second example, I see that the task is to identify the hypernym, or a word that is a more general category, for the given entity.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (sophisticated, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _also_see of sophisticated? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Based on the analogy examples provided, I understand that the task involves predicting the tail entity in a sentence completion task, where the tail entity is the answer to "what is the _also_see of [MASK]" for a given [MASK]. I also note that the tail entities in the examples share a relationship of similar meaning or function with the initial [MASK]. Therefore, I will use this pattern to sort the candidate answers for the goal question by looking for the answer that has the

Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (worldly, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _also_see of worldly? The answer is ". The answer is sophisticated, so the [MASK] is sophisticated. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (elegant, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _also_see of elegant?

Based on the supplement information examples provided, I further understand that the tail entities are synonymous or closely related terms to the [MASK] given in the initial sentence. In these cases, worldly, elegant, and sophisticated all share a similar meaning or are closely related terms. Therefore, while sorting the candidate answers for the goal question, I will look for the answer that has a meaning or function most similar to or closely related to the given [MASK] - sophisticated. I will also take into

Based on the additional analogy examples provided, I further understand that the tail entities in the given sentences share a functional or causal relationship with the [MASK]. In these cases, noncompliant and unwilling, modern and new, unsmooth and uneven, set and replace all share a functional or causal relationship. Therefore, while sorting the candidate answers for the goal question, I will not only look for the answer that has a meaning or function most similar to or closely related

From these examples, I observe that the tail entity in the [MASK] position is being used to complete the phrase "derivationally related form of" in relation to the given entity. The correct answer for the [MASK] position is typically the given word's derivational form, which is a new word formed from the given word by applying certain morphological operations such as suffixation, prefixation, or infixation.

In the first example, the derivational form of

Thank you for the examples. Based on these, I can see that the task involves predicting the hypernym of a given entity. I will attempt to use this analogy to help me understand the goal question and sort the candidate answers accordingly.

From the examples, it appears that the hypernyms are more general terms that encompass the given entity. For instance, the hypernym of "make" is "modify", since modify is a more general term that includes making as one

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (major premiss, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of major premiss? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Based on the given examples, the following pattern can be observed:

1. The goal is to predict the hypernym of a given entity.
2. The hypernym is a more general category that encompasses the given entity.

******
Based on the supplementary information provided, it can be inferred that the relationship between "major premiss" and "syllogism" is one of a part-to-whole relationship. This suggests that the hypernym of "major premiss" should be a more general category that encompasses the concept of a part of a syllogism.

In summation, the approach to sorting the candidate answers for the goal question will involve the following steps:

The new examples provided further illustrate the pattern of predicting the hypernym of a given entity. The hypernym is a more general category that encompasses the given entity. The goal question can be solved by identifying the more general category that includes the "major premiss".

Additionally, the supplementary information provided indicates that "major premiss" is a part of a "syllogism" and "genus caretta" is a part of a "reptile

The examples given suggest that the hypernym can also refer to a superordinate concept that is more generic in nature, such as "picture show" being a superordinate category for "collage film", or "railway locomotive" being a superordinate category for "diesel locomotive". The search for a hypernym therefore should consider broader, more general categories that the given entity can fall under.

The examples given so far suggest that the hypernym of a given entity can be a categorization of that entity at a higher level of abstraction.

Based on the given additional analogy examples, I can observe a broader range of head entities being used, from specific objects, actions, and ideas to abstract qualities. Each head entity has a specific hypernym that provides a more general category for it, enabling clarification and organization.

Taking into account these examples, as well as the earlier ones provided, I will approach the task of sorting the candidate answers for the original goal question. By recognizing the patterns and relationships in the given

From the provided analogy examples, I can observe that head entities encompass various objects, actions, and concepts. The tail entities of these examples provide higher levels of abstraction that help in categorizing the head entities.

With this in mind, I will proceed to sort the candidate answers for the original goal question by looking for hypernyms that provide a consistent and meaningful categorization for the provided head entity. The supplementary information will help me sort the answers in order of relevance

Based on the given analogy examples, I can now see that the head entities encompass a range of emotions, Islamic calendar months, actions, and concepts. The tail entities help in categorizing the head entities by providing unifying abstractions.

Now that I have thought about and internalized these examples, I am prepared to sort the candidate answers for the original goal question by looking for the most suitable hypernym that maintains a consistent and meaningful categorization, considering the head entity auf

Based on these additional examples, I can recognize that the head entities cover various increasingly specific persons, actions, and concepts, including professions, potential criminals, architectural components, and religious assets. The tail entities provide appropriate and meaningful abstractions for categorizing the head entities.

Now, with these examples in mind, I can focus on sorting the candidate answers for the original goal question by carefully looking for the most relevant and accurate hypernym, taking care to identify the overarch

After analyzing these examples, I realize that the head entities cover diverse objects and actions, including tree barks, improvements, textual analyses, ambulation, and countless others. The tail entities offer effective and consistent generalization for the head entities, making it easier to understand and categorize them.

Considering these examples, I can accurately sort the candidate answers for the original goal question by carefully examining each hypernym, ensuring they meaningfully connect with the head entity and accurately

Based on the examples provided with supplementary information, I can see that "roof" has been given as an answer for a few of the questions. This tells me that "roof" is an important concept for the current prediction task, so I should consider it as a potential hypernym for the given entity "roof". I will use this information and my prior knowledge of roofs being a part of edifices to help me with the sorting task. However, I will still keep

Based on the new examples given for analogy, I can see that the concept of a "genus" and "youth subculture" are also important, and I should also consider these as potential hypernyms. I can also see that "portion" and "exchange" are possible values for the [MASK]. However, I should be careful since these are not as closely related to the original question as the previous examples that included "roof". I will use this additional

I see, so based on the new examples given with supplementary information, the concept of a "dome" and "sunshine-roof" are also closely related to the original question and they are both hypernyms of the given entity "roof".

I will keep the word "roof" in mind and prioritize it as a potential candidate answer, as it appears frequently in the examples and the supplementary information

From these examples, I can see that the answers are more abstract or general concepts, such as "immaturity", "semantic relation", "antibiotic drug", and "performance". These examples can help me understand the task better and consider more general concepts when sorting the candidate answers. However, since these answers are quite different from "roof", I will keep this new information in mind and continue to prioritize the "roof" as a high-priority candidate answer

From these examples, I can see that the concept of a "hypernym" can encompass a broader or more general category, as seen with "picture show" for "collage film", "lure" for "fisherman's lure", "yell" for "yelling", and "railway locomotive" for "diesel locomotive". These examples will help me to consider broader categories of hypernyms for the original question "predict the

From this new set of examples, I understand that the concept of a "hypernym" can refer to both specific and general concepts in different contexts. In the case of "sorrow" and "unhappiness", "muharrum" and "islamic calendar month", "subcontract" and "hire", there is a clear hierarchy of narrower and broader concepts.

I can see that these examples involve both specific and more general hypernyms. The concept of a "hypernym" can refer to a direct superordinate concept, such as "physician" for "abortionist", or a more general concept like "structure" for "tower". This will helped me to sort the candidate answers more accurately when I predict the hypernym of "roof".

I understand the concept of hypernymy and how it relates to the task of predicting the hypernym of an entity, as demonstrated in these examples. In the case of "dita bark" and "tree", "modernize" and "change", "textual criticism" and "literary criticism", the hypernym is a more general concept than the original entity. While in the case of "walk" and "play", the hypernym refers to a broader category that also

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I understand that my role is to perform link prediction and sort a given list of candidate answers in order of likelihood, with the most probable answers appearing first. I will strive to provide a helpful and accurate response.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (number, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of number? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Understood. From these examples, I can infer that the goal is to predict the deriving form of a given word. This is done by analyzing the given context and predicting the word that completes the sentence. In the first example, "set up" is used in the context of deriving "effect". Similarly, in the second example, "understanding" is used in the context of deriving "misunderstand". The third example shows that "hold" derives

Understood. From these supplementary examples, I can infer that the goal question may require me to understand the relationships between words in different contexts, such as the hypernymy and derivational relationships. The first example shows that "crosshatch" has the hypernym "shade", meaning that "shade" is a general term that encompasses "crosshatch". The second example shows that "hatching" is related to "crosshatch" through

Understood. I will keep in mind the analogies and their corresponding answers provided in the previous examples. The first example shows that "record" is related to "registrar" while the second example demonstrates that "recidivism" is related to "retrogress". The third example illustrates that "nickname" is associated with "soubriquet" and the last example suggests that "think" is related to "think" itself. This information may be useful

From these additional examples, I understand that identifying the "derivationally related form" of a word can involve taking the root form or identifying a related concept or meaning. The examples provided show that this can include different parts of speech, such as verb to noun ("incubate" to "incubator"), noun to adjective ("mindfulness" to "mindful"), or verb to verb ("stabilize" to "stabilization").

These examples show a mix of taking a root form, changing to a different part of speech, and identifying a related concept or meaning. I will consider these observations as I answer the original goal question. The example for "interestingness" with the answer "matter to" suggests that the task can sometimes require identifying a related concept or meaning, rather than a straightforward morphological transformation of the original word.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (conduct, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of conduct? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

The answer is modify, so the [MASK] is modify. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (physical object, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of physical object?

I understand that the examples are demonstrating the task of predicting a hypernym for a given entity. In the first example, the entity "make" has the hypernym "modify". In the second example, the entity "physical object" has the hypernym "physical entity". The third example shows that the entity "garnet" has the hypernym "transparent gem". The fourth and last example demonstrates that the entity "caudate nucleus" has the

The answer is ". The answer is conduct, so the [MASK] is conduct. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
From the supplementary examples, I can infer that the task often involves concepts that are related to each other in various ways, such as derivationally related forms and verb groups. These relationships suggest a strong connection between the given entity and the answer, which may help in predicting the correct answer for the hypernym task as well.

I can also observe that the examples demonstrate a pattern in which the first entity provides context or leads to the second entity. For instance, in the first supplement

The answer is ". The answer is exchange, so the [MASK] is exchange. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
In the new analogical examples, I observe that the hypernym relationship is being used consistently. For instance, "genus caretta" has the hypernym "reptile genus", which indicates a more generic category. Similarly, "piece" has the hypernym "portion" and "break" has the hypernym "exchange". In the "hipsters" example, the hypernym "youth subculture" provides a broader categorization that encapsulates the "hip

The supplementary examples demonstrate that there are multiple derivationally related forms for a single given word. For instance, the word "conduct" has two derivationally related forms: "music director" and "conducting". These examples suggest that I should consider and explore multiple possible derivationally related forms when performing the link prediction and sorting task.

Incorporating the insights from the analogical and supplementary examples, I will consider the possibility that a single given word can

******
In these additional analogical examples, I observe the use of the hypernym relation to categorize two distinct entities, such as "jew's-ears" being categorized as a "jelly fungus" and "hydrogen carbonate" as a "carbonate". The task seems to identify the more general category that a given entity belongs to, and by considering the examples provided, I can make educated predictions for the sorting task.

To summarize,

Continuing to analyze the analogous examples, I observe a sustained pattern of hypernym relationships being used to identify the broader categories to which the entities belong.

For instance, the term "puerility" is identified as a type of "immaturity", "neomycin" as an instance of an "antibiotic drug", and the "part to whole relation" as a kind of "semantic relation". Understanding the use of hypernym relationships, I can identify

******
After analyzing the analogous examples, I can discern that the pattern of using hypernym relationships to categorize entities holds consistent.

For example, "collage film" is a type of "picture show", "fisherman's lure" is an instance of "lure", and "diesel locomotive" falls under the category of "railway locomotive". With this understanding, I can now apply the same reasoning process to the original sort

The answer is ". The answer is set, so the [MASK] is set. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
After carefully considering the analogical examples, I have observed that hypernyms can help categorize the given entities into broader categories, making it easier to understand the underlying relationships.

For instance,

* "sorrow" is categorized under "unhappiness"
* "muharrum" is a part of the "Islamic calendar month"
* "subcontract" falls under the umbrella category of "hire"
* "parallelize"

******
By reviewing the analogical examples, I can see the systematic use of hypernyms to categorize given entities, allowing for a better understanding of the relationship between the concepts. For example,

* An "abortionist" can be categorized under the more general category of "physician"
* The term "suspect" falls under the hypernym "venture" in this context
* "Tower" is a specific example of a general term "structure"

I understand. The supplementary information provided in these examples indicates that the task not only involves understanding the hypernym relationships between entities, but also the derivationally related forms. In other words, the task requires identifying entities that are related through a common root or stem, even if they are not directly linked through a hypernym relationship. This adds an additional layer of complexity to the task, as it requires the ability to identify and understand the relationships between words at a more granular level.

I have analyzed the given examples and noted the relationship between the given word and its derivationally related form. In the first example, "set up" and "effect" have a clear relationship - "effect" is the result or outcome of "setting up" something. Similarly, in the second example, "misunderstanding" is closely related to the term "misunderstand," which means to fail to understand properly.

I have analyzed the supplementary information, focusing on the hypernym relationships. In these examples, I have noted that "call out," "sound," "publicize," and "post" all have "denote" as their hypernym. This means that "denote" represents a more general category that encompasses the other terms and their specific meanings.

With this understanding of the supplementary information, I now have a clearer sense of the context in which "denote

Based on the additional examples, I see a clear relationship between "denote" and "inform" as "denote" represents a more specific category of "inform."

Furthermore, I have noted that both "announcer" and "report" have a hypernym relationship with "denote," indicating a more general category relationship.

Given this understanding, I will now proceed to sort the candidate answers for the original question.

From the given examples, I can observe the patterns and relationships that the hypernym of a specific entity generally encompasses its broader category or definition. In these instances, the goal is to predict the tail entity that correctly describes the hypernym of the given entity.

In the first example, the hypernym of "make" is "modify," which expresses a broader category of actions that includes making.

The second example illustrates that the hypernym of "physical object

After analyzing the additional examples, I can see more clearly that the task demands to identify the correct hypernym based on the given entity. Here are my summarized insights:

1. The hypernym can be a broader category, genus, or subculture.
2. The answer could include the word "genus," indicating a taxonomic group in biology.
3. Sometimes, the answer can be a more generic term like "portion" or "exchange

By analyzing the additional examples, I observe that:

1. The hypernym could be a specific type or category of a broader family, such as "jelly fungus" or "carbonate."
2. In some cases, the answer might require identifying the type of process, e.g., "implementation" in the case of "motorization."
3. It is possible that the hypernym refers to a specific state, like "unconsciousness

By analyzing the examples given, I can identify the following patterns:

1. In some cases, the hypernym could refer to a more general concept related to morality, traits, or behaviors, such as "immaturity" being the hypernym of "puerility."
2. The hypernym could also reflect a more general concept or category encompassing specific relations or correspondences, such as "semantic relation" being the hypernym of "part to whole relation

From these examples, I can see that the derivationally related form of some words is a word that is involved in its meaning or function, providing additional context or explanation.

For instance, the derivationally related form of "hold on" is "hold," which is a more basic form of the word. Similarly, the derivationally related form of "mindfulness" is "mindful," which provides more detail about the meaning of the word.

From this additional information, I can see that "style" is related to "stylize" in a similar way as "mindfulness" is related to "mindful" - "stylize" provides more detail about the meaning of "style."

This reinforces the idea that in some cases, the derivationally related form of a word is a form that offers more context or explanation about the meaning of the word itself.

From these examples, I can see that the derivationally related form of a word can sometimes be the same as the word itself.

This is the case with "structure" and "organization", where the derivationally related form of both words is the word itself.

However, in other cases, the derivationally related form of a word is a different word that is related to the original word in some way.

It seems that the goal is to identify the derivationally related form of a given word. From the examples, we can see that the derivationally related form is a word that is somehow related to the original word, either as a variation, a synonym, a related concept, or an antonym. To sort the candidate answers, we need to determine the degree of relatedness between the given word and each candidate answer, and select the answer that has the closest relationship to the given

Based on the newly provided analogies, I can observe more possible types of relationships between entities.

From these examples, I notice that the relationship between the subject and the missing word is more about the word's function or an action.

Here, the subject gives a clue about the action or function of the missing word. It's helpful to understand the meaning and use of the subject.

In the first example, "scribble" is a verb conveying the meaning of writing or drawing in a careless or hurried way. In this case, the missing word is "

Yes, I understand the instructions. I will carefully review the examples and memorize any helpful information to assist in sorting the candidate answers for the given goal question. I will remain silent while you provide the examples.

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (make, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of make? The answer is ". The answer is modify, so the [MASK] is modify. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (physical object, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of physical object? The answer is ". The answer is physical entity, so the [MASK] is physical entity. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (garnet, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of garnet? The answer is ". The answer is transparent gem, so the [MASK] is transparent gem. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (caudate nucleus, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of caudate nucleus? The answer is ". The answer is basal ganglion, so the [MASK] is basal ganglion. " Keep thinking but not output.

I understand. Based on the provided examples, the goal question involves predicting the hypernym of a given entity. This task requires identifying the broader category or concept to which the entity belongs. From the examples, I can see that the masked portion of the given sentence is meant to be replaced by the hypernym of the first entity.

Here are the examples with the masked portion filled in:

* make: _hypernym of_ modify, the answer is modify.
******
Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (genus caretta, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of genus caretta? The answer is ". The answer is reptile genus, so the [MASK] is reptile genus. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (hipsters, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of hipsters? The answer is ". The answer is youth subculture, so the [MASK] is youth subculture. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (piece, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of piece? The answer is ". The answer is portion, so the [MASK] is portion. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (break, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of break? The answer is ". The answer is exchange, so the [MASK] is exchange. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the additional examples, I can see that the hypernym of an entity can be a more general or inclusive category that encompasses the entity. For instance, the hypernym of "genus caretta" is "reptile genus," while the hypernym of "hipsters" is "youth subculture." I can also observe that the hypernym of a word may be a more abstract concept, such as "exchange" being the hypernym of "break."

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (jew's-ears, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of jew's-ears? The answer is ". The answer is jelly fungus, so the [MASK] is jelly fungus. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (motorization, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of motorization? The answer is ". The answer is implementation, so the [MASK] is implementation. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (hydrogen carbonate, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of hydrogen carbonate?

The answer is carbonate, so the [MASK] is carbonate. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (comatoseness, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of comatoseness? The answer is ". The answer is unconsciousness, so the [MASK] is unconsciousness. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
I see that the task requires me to understand the hierarchy and relationships between different entities and concepts. In some cases, the hypernym of an entity can be a subcategory or a more specific term, like "jelly fungus" for "jew's-ears." In other cases, the hypernym can represent a more general or abstract concept, like "implementation" for "motorization" or "unconsciousness" for "comatoseness." These examples also

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (puerility, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of puerility? The answer is ".

The answer is ". The answer is semantic relation, so the [MASK] is semantic relation. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (neomycin, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of neomycin? The answer is ". The answer is antibiotic drug, so the [MASK] is antibiotic drug. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (trick, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of trick? The answer is ". The answer is performance, so the [MASK] is performance. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
I see that in some examples, the hypernym is a more abstract or general concept than the given entity, such as going from "puerility" to "immaturity". In other cases, the hypernym is a broader category that includes the given entity, such as when "neomycin" is a type of "antibiotic drug". It seems important to consider the context and relationship between the given entity and the concept it belongs to. I will keep this in mind as

The answer is ". The answer is railway locomotive, so the [MASK] is railway locomotive. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
I see that in some examples, the hypernym is a superordinate term that is more general and encompasses the given term, such as "picture show" for "collage film" or "lure" for "fisherman's lure". In other examples, the hypernym is a term that represents a more specific category, like "yell" for "yelling" or "railway locomotive" for "diesel locomotive".

I understand that I need to identify the hypernym of a given entity by using the examples to help guide me in determining the broader or more general category or concept that the entity belongs to. The hypernym can be a superordinate term that is more abstract or general than the given entity, or it can be a term that represents a more specific category that the entity belongs to. I will consider the hierarchy and relationships between different entities and concepts to sort the candidate answers for the given goal question.

From the given examples, I can see that the task is to predict the `_instance_hypernym of` for various given entities. The instances of hypernym for `erin` is `ireland`, for `marlene dietrich` is `vocalizer`, for `williams` is `reverend`, and for `crohn` is `physician`. This suggests that the `_instance_hypernym of` for a given entity might be a specific

The answer is ". The answer is thespian, so the [MASK] is thespian. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
From the additional information provided, it is clear that `fred astaire` has two possible instances of hypernym, `choreographer` and `thespian`. This reinforces the earlier observation that the instances of hypernym for a given entity might be a specific occupation or role associated with the entity. This knowledge will be helpful in ordering the candidate answers for the goal question.

These additional examples further illustrate the diversity of possible instances of hypernym, from urban centers to suburbia, territories, and geographical regions. The `bluegrass region` example is especially relevant to the `fred astaire` example in the goal question, as both relate to modern cultural icons and may share a similar type of hypernym. This reinforces the need to consider the context of the given entity when determining the most likely hypernym.

I am carefully considering the given examples and using them to help me understand the potential meaning of the goal question. Based on the examples, it seems that the task is to predict the derivationally related form of a given word. In each case, the given word is followed by the phrase "derivationally related form of" and a blank space, and the goal is to fill in the blank space with the word that is derivationally related to the given word.

I am continuing to consider the given examples and the supplementary information they provide. It seems that in some cases, the task is to predict a hypernym of a given word, rather than a derivationally related form. A hypernym is a word that is a general category or class that includes a more specific instance. For example, the word "tract" is a hypernym of "glade" because a glade is a type of tract.

Based on the supplementary information, I will consider relationships based on both hypernym and derivationally related forms when sorting the candidate answers for the main task.

These relationships suggest that vomiting can be related to both a hypernym "unconditioned reflex" and derivationally related forms like "vomit up" and "rumination." Therefore, when I encounter entities related to "vomiting" in terms of the provided relationships, I will consider both hyperny

******
From these additional examples, I note that the hypernym relationships may not always be immediately apparent, as "genus caretta" is hypernymed to the higher-level "reptile genus," and "hipsters" are hypernymed to "youth subculture." These examples suggest that I should have a broader understanding of the concepts the entities relate to when sorting the candidate answers.

Furthermore, there are cases where the given entities have hypernyms

******
Considering the provided supplementary information example, I have learned that "hematemesis" is hypernymed to the entity "vomiting," indicating a similar relationship between the word "vomiting" and its hypernym. This reinforces my previous understanding of the concept and will help me make more informed judgments when I start sorting the provided candidate answers.

After thoroughly analyzing the provided examples, I'm now prepared to proceed with sorting the candidate answers accordingly

******
From the auxiliary analogies, I observe that hypernym relationships can vary between more abstract concepts, as illustrated by "motorization" and its hypernym "implementation," or more specific entities, such as "jew's-ears" and its hypernym "jelly fungus." These examples emphasize the significance of considering a variety of possible relationships when determining the most fitting hypernym.

These additional examples further highlight the importance of considering varied relationships and abstraction levels.

1. "Puerility" is hypernymed to the higher-level entity "immaturity," which indicates that sometimes the hypernym relationship can be connected to personal development and emotional states.
2. In the case of "part to whole relation," it is related to the broader category of "semantic relation." These examples reveal that sometimes the entities might bridge the gap between linguistics and

The extra examples emphasize that sometimes the hypernym relationships can involve specific objects, actions, or concepts being classified under a broader category.

1. "Collage film" is a specific type of "picture show" that provides a clear hierarchical relationship between the two.

I will consider these additional examples, which continue to demonstrate a variety of relationships across numerous taxonomic hierarchies. These cases solidify the importance of evaluating different aspects, such as categorizing abstract emotions, religious connotations, and entities involving action-related concepts.

These extra examples illustrate even more diverse relationships that demonstrate the task's complex nature.

1. In the case of "abortionist," the hypernym relationship extends to "physician," a broader profession representing a type of individual.
2. With "suspect," we observe a specific term in the business world, while its hypernym "venture" is more general.

The additional examples reveal further nuances in the relationships, including entities from botanical and leisure domains.

1. The "dita bark" example demonstrates a straightforward relationship, as its hypernym "tree" grounds it in the botanical classification.
2. The verb "modernize" hypernym is "change," describing the action as a transformation.

Based on the analogy examples, I can see that the task involves predicting the tail entity in a given relation based on a query word and completing the sentence with the derivationally related form of the query word.

The answers in the examples suggest that the tail entity could be a word that shares a common morpheme or affix, or has a related meaning to the query word.

I will keep these examples and thinking in mind as I process the additional information.

Based on these examples, it seems that the derivationally related form of the word in the first entity may not always be a new word, but could also be the same word itself. In addition, it is possible for the derivationally related form to represent an action, such as "stop over" to "stop".

These examples suggest that I should consider the possibility of a word being its own derivationally related form and also the potential for the form to be an action,
