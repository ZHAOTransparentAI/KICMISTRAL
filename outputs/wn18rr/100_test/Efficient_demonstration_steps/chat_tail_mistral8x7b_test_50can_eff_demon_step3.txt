Based on the supplementary information provided in the examples, I can see that the hypernym of "station" and "setting" is also "position", which strengthens the idea that the hypernym of "position" would also be "position" itself.

The process of determining the hypernym requires understanding the relationship between the concept and its broader categories. This reinforces the idea that the hypernym of "position" would need to be a broader category that includes position. I will consider this while sorting the candidate answers.

Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (pitch, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of pitch? The answer is ". The answer is position, so the [MASK] is position. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (position, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of position?

The answer is ". The answer is position, so the [MASK] is position. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
The examples provided give supplementary information that strengthens the conclusion that "position" is its own hypernym. This is because "pitch", a clearly related concept, has "position" as its hypernym. Additionally, "situation" and "front" are also identified as having "position" as their hypernym. The information about "set" being a derivationally related form of "position" further underscores the idea that position is a very central concept in English language

The new examples provided give additional contexts for understanding the task and identifying hypernyms, which can help me better understand the task. However, none of these examples impact my previous conclusions about the hypernym of "position".

The example with "jew's-ears" and "jelly fungus" highlights how a hypernym can be a more specific term than the original word, while the example with "motorization" and "implementation" demonstrates how a

As I process the additional information from the examples, I continue to notice a pattern emerging. In many cases, the concept of "position" is identified as a hypernym or derivationally related form of various words. This suggests that the concept of position is a fundamental concept in language and can be related to a wide variety of words and concepts.

I also notice in the new examples that the word "station" has "position" as its hypernym, which further strengthens my previous

******
After reading and analyzing the examples, I have noticed that in each of them, the hypernym is a broader category or concept that encompasses the given word or phrase. From this, I can infer that for the goal question, the hypernym of "position" should be a broad category that contains various positions.

The supplementary information provided in the examples further reinforces this idea. In the examples related to "position," the hypernym is also "position," indicating that

Based on the examples provided, I notice that the hypernym is generally a more general class or category that the given word falls under. For instance, a collage film is a type of picture show, and a fisherman's lure is a type of lure. Similarly, in the case of "position," the hypernym would be a more general category that encompasses positions.

The supplementary information given further reinforces this understanding, showing that "position" is

The above examples suggest that when determining the hypernym of a word, it is important to consider its broader category or classification. For instance, "sorrow" is a specific type of "unhappiness," just as "muharrum" is a specific month in the "Islamic calendar month."

Similarly, "subcontract" is a type of "hire", and "parallelize" falls under the category of "set." Thus, when predicting the

I understand that these additional examples provide supplementary information to help me better understand the task.

The first of these new examples is consistent with the earlier examples in following the pattern of predicting a hypernym for a given entity. The entity "spear" has the hypernym "transfix," which is a more general term describing a similar concept.

The second and third examples further introduce the concept of derivationally related forms. In the first part, "transfix" is

******
From the given analogical examples, I notice another pattern for the task. In these examples, the hypernym of a given entity could be a broader concept related to the more specific entity. For example, in the first example, genus caretta is a type of reptile genus. Similarly, for the second example, hipsters could be categorized as a type of youth subculture.

The third and fourth examples focus on parts or actions that are components of more extensive concepts.

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (jew's-ears, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of jew's-ears? The answer is ". The answer is jelly fungus, so the [MASK] is jelly fungus. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (motorization, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of motorization?

The answer is implementation, so the [MASK] is implementation. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (hydrogen carbonate, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of hydrogen carbonate?

The answer is ". The answer is unconsciousness, so the [MASK] is unconsciousness. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
From these additional examples, I can further observe patterns in the task. For some entities, their hypernyms can represent higher levels within the taxonomy. For example, jew's-ears are a type of jelly fungus, and hydrogen carbonate is a type of carbonate.

In some cases, the hypernym could refer to general concepts or actions that encompass the given entity. For instance, in the motorization example, motorization falls under the hypernym

These examples further illustrate the pattern of hypernyms describing broader concepts that describe the given entities. For instance, in the first example, puerility can be categorized under immaturity. Similarly, in the last example, tricks are a specific type of performance.

Additionally, specific terms can also have hypernyms that describe a particular category they belong to. For example, in the third example, neomycin is a type of antibiotic drug, and, in

These examples demonstrate that the hypernyms can describe entities with a similar function or form. In the first example, collage films belong to a broader category of picture shows. Similarly, the hypernym of a fisherman's lure refers to a more general yet related concept, the lure itself, in the second example.

The third example encompasses specific instances of yelling under the broader hypernym of yell, and, in the last example, the diesel loc

I have read the examples for analogy and will continue to think about how they may be relevant to the sorting task. The goal question involves predicting the tail entity in a sentence that includes "_derivationally_related_form of" by filling in the [MASK] placeholder.

Considering these new analogical examples, I see that the \_derivationally\_related\_form of a word can sometimes be a reflexive repetition of that same word, as seen in the examples of "stop," "cook," and "trail." However, the more complex example of "touch" indicates that sometimes the \_derivationally\_related\_form may entail the concept, but be slightly more expansive, such as "physical contact"

Based on the given examples, the sorting task requires me to predict the hypernym of the given entity in the input sentence. The hypernym represents a more general concept that includes instances of the given entity. In other words, if I see a more specific entity mentioned as a hypernym in a given example, then it is likely that the correct answer to the goal question will be a more general concept as well.

Thus, in order to sort the candidate answers to the goal question

Based on the supplementary information, the goal question is asking for the hypernym of "coelenterate family." Additionally, we have a "kingdom animalia" and its meronym "coelenterate family" mentioned, which further confirms that "coelenterate family" is a lower-level concept within the broader taxonomy of animals.

Based on the new given examples, I will summarize the way of thinking as follows:

For each example, the task is to predict the hypernym of the given entity. The hypernym is a more general concept that includes the given entity as a part or a specific instance. The answer will depend on the given example and the specific entity in question.

Using the new examples, I can further refine my strategy for sorting the candidate answers to the goal question:

I will continue to summarize the pattern in the newly provided examples:

For each example, the task is to predict the hypernym of a given entity. The hypernym represents a more general concept that includes the given entity as a specific type, part, or instance.

Based on the last set of examples, I have noticed that the derivationally\_related\_form relationship can be bidirectional, as shown in the example "hold on - hold." This means that I have to consider both directions of the relationship

In some cases, the related word can be a more specific form of the starting word, such as "mindfulness" and "mindful", while in other cases, it can be a more general form, such as "incubate

Based on these examples, I can see that the derivationally\_related\_form relationship can result in words with different parts of speech. For instance, "promote" and "promotion" have different parts of speech, and "pollute" and "polluter" have different parts of speech as well.

Furthermore, the related\_form can be a phrase instead of a single word, such as "matter to" for "interestingness". Therefore,

Based on the additional examples provided, I can further refine my understanding of the hypernym relationship between entities.

The hypernym of an entity can be a broader category or a more general classifying term, and it can also define a more specific characteristic of that entity.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I understand that my goal is to perform link prediction and sorting based on a given goal question and a list of candidate answers. I will sort the candidate answers in the list so that the most likely answers appear prior to less likely ones.
******
The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (grant, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of grant? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.
******
Yes, I understand that I should carefully read, realize, and think about the given examples to help with the sorting task. I will identify similarities to the goal question and capture any supplementary information provided. By summarizing potential relationships and meanings, I can better perform the link prediction and sorting task once it is my turn to output.
******
Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (make, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of make? The answer is ". The answer is modify, so the [MASK] is modify. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (physical object, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of physical object? The answer is ". The answer is physical entity, so the [MASK] is physical entity. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (garnet, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of garnet? The answer is ". The answer is transparent gem, so the [MASK] is transparent gem. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (caudate nucleus, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of caudate nucleus? The answer is ". The answer is basal ganglion, so the [MASK] is basal ganglion. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the provided examples, I will be analogy on the structure and pattern of the sentences, and memorize the answers as well as the tail entities to answer the masked [MASK] part in the goal question. Here are the insights from each example:

1. In the first example, from the given relationship between "make" and "hypernym of", the missing term is "modify".
2. In the second example, the missing term for the given pair "

Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (grant, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of grant? The answer is ". The answer is grant, so the [MASK] is grant. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (grant, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of grant? The answer is ". The answer is grant, so the [MASK] is grant. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (grant-in-aid, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of grant-in-aid? The answer is ". The answer is grant, so the [MASK] is grant. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
With the supplementary information examples provided, the key insight is the relationship between different words and their various categories, classifications, and forms. For instance, in the first and second examples, the derivationally related form of "grant" is itself. In the third example, a hypernym of "grant-in-aid" is "grant", suggesting a broader category or a superclass relationship in this context. By internalizing these insights, I can apply this knowledge to the
******
Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (genus caretta, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of genus caretta? The answer is ". The answer is reptile genus, so the [MASK] is reptile genus. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (hipsters, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of hipsters? The answer is ". The answer is youth subculture, so the [MASK] is youth subculture. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (piece, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of piece? The answer is ". The answer is portion, so the [MASK] is portion. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (break, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of break? The answer is ". The answer is exchange, so the [MASK] is exchange. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the additional examples provided, I will now integrate these examples to further inform my understanding of the sorting task. I note the following insights from these examples:

1. In the first example, the given entity is a specific genus, and its hypernym is a more general class, "reptile genus".
2. In the second example, "hipsters" is a specific instance of a "youth subculture", and this pattern reflects a more general taxonom

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (jew's-ears, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of jew's-ears? The answer is ". The answer is jelly fungus, so the [MASK] is jelly fungus. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (motorization, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of motorization? The answer is ". The answer is implementation, so the [MASK] is implementation. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (hydrogen carbonate, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of hydrogen carbonate? The answer is ". The answer is carbonate, so the [MASK] is carbonate. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (comatoseness, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of comatoseness? The answer is ". The answer is unconsciousness, so the [MASK] is unconsciousness. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
After examining these additional exemplars, I have observed the following:

1. In the first instance, "jew's-ears" is clearly a specific instance of "jelly fungus", demonstrating a broader to narrower distinction that fits the hypernymic pattern.
2. In the second example, "motorization" is a broader term than "implementation", representing another instance of a hypernymic relationship. This counterexample, however, suggests that

The answer is ". The answer is semantic relation, so the [MASK] is semantic relation. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (neomycin, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of neomycin?

The answer is antibiotic drug, so the [MASK] is antibiotic drug. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (trick, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of trick? The answer is ". The answer is performance, so the [MASK] is performance. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on these additional exemplars, I have observed:

1. In the first example, "puerility" is a specific instance of "immaturity", illustrating a typical hypernymic relationship.
2. In the second example, "part to whole relation" is a more specialized term compared to "semantic relation", further reinforcing a hypernymic pattern.
3. The third example, "neomycin", is a species of "antibi

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (collage film, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of collage film? The answer is ". The answer is picture show, so the [MASK] is picture show. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (fisherman's lure, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of fisherman's lure?

The answer is lure, so the [MASK] is lure. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (yelling, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of yelling? The answer is ". The answer is yell, so the [MASK] is yell. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (diesel locomotive, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of diesel locomotive? The answer is ". The answer is railway locomotive, so the [MASK] is railway locomotive. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Taking stock of these examples, I have observed:

1. In the first instance, "collage film" is a more specific term than "picture show", representing a typical hypernymic relationship.
2. The second example, "fisherman's lure", is a type of "lure", demonstrating the same hypernymic pattern.
3. In the third example, "yelling" is a form of "yell", which is a hypernym

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (sorrow, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of sorrow? The answer is ". The answer is unhappiness, so the [MASK] is unhappiness. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (muharrum, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of muharrum? The answer is ". The answer is islamic calendar month, so the [MASK] is islamic calendar month. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (subcontract, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of subcontract?

The answer is hire, so the [MASK] is hire. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (parallelize, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of parallelize? The answer is ". The answer is set, so the [MASK] is set. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
As I analyze these new examples, I observe that:

1. "Sorrow" is a specific instance of "unhappiness", aligning with the hypernymic relationship.
2. In the second example, "muharram" is a part of the "Islamic calendar month", illustrating how a specific term is related to a more general one.
3. The third example, "subcontract", is associated with "hire" in a hierarch

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (time to come, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of time to come? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.

From the given examples, I can observe that the task involves predicting the hypernym of a given entity in a cloze-style sentence. Memorizing this pattern, I can see that the hypernyms provided as answers in the examples are more general than the given entities.

Using analogy, I can infer that when predicting the hypernym of "time to come" in the goal question, I should consider a word that is more general than "time to come" and

From the supplementary information, I can observe that the task has another version, which involves predicting the derivationally related form of a given entity. Memorizing this pattern, I can see that "time to come" and "future" are derivationally related.

Using this information, I can infer that the hypernym of "time to come" could have a relationship with the concept of "future." Additionally, I can use the same memorized patterns from the previous examples

From the additional examples, I can further observe the pattern of predicting the hypernym of a given entity by considering a more general concept. Applying this pattern to the given goal question, I can infer that the hypernym of "time to come" should be a general concept that encompasses the idea of a period in the future. Memorizing the specific answers from these examples, I can also use analogical reasoning to deduce the possible hypernym of "time to come."

1. A similar pattern is observed between "refine" and "refiner" as in "set up" and "set." This can indicate that a noun can transform into a verb (or _derivationally_related_form) with similar meaning.
2. Another pattern is observed that a verb can also transform into a noun (or

Based on the examples given for analogy, I can infer that the goal question is asking for the parts or components of a given entity. In each of the examples, the entity is a noun that represents a broad concept or process, and the answer is a specific part or component of that concept or process. Therefore, for the goal question, I should sort the candidate answers based on whether they are specific parts or components of the entity "kilobyte."

Thank you for the additional examples. From these examples, I can see that the given entity "roof" is a type of physical entity and is the hypernym of other entities such as "vault" and "saddleback roof". I also learned that "roof" can be a derivationally related form of another entity, and it can also be a part of another entity like an "edifice".

Sure, I will continue to think. I can see that in the previous examples, some of the derivationally related forms were nouns or adjectives related to the given word by common morphological constituents (suffixes, prefixes), shared roots, or paronyms.

For instance, in the case of "reverence" and "reverent", the related form was an adjective, while for "promote" and "promotion",

From the examples given, I understand that the task requires analogical reasoning based on the linguistic relationship between the given word and its derivationally related form. In some cases, the relational concept may involve transforming the given word into a noun or verb form derived from its root, as in the case of "unify" with the answer "mixture" or "promote" with the answer "promotion".

In other cases, the relationship may involve finding a word

From these examples, I can see that the task requires me to identify the derivationally related form of a given word, which could be a noun, verb, or adjective. I also need to understand the context and the relationship between the words to derive the correct answer.

For instance, in the example "think, _derivationally\_related\_form of, [MASK]", the answer is "thought" as it is the noun form of the verb

With the additional examples, the pattern becomes clearer. The provided entity can be a more specific instance, and the hypernym can represent a more general class or category that the entity belongs to.

Understood. I will keep thinking about these examples and how they relate to the goal question without outputting anything yet.

From the given examples, I can see a pattern emerging where the tail entity in each case is a hypernym of the given entity. This suggests that my task in the goal question is to find a hypernym of the given entity, "podcast."

The examples also suggest that I should consider more specific hypernyms first, such as "modify"

Thank you for the additional examples. From these new examples, I can further refine my understanding of the pattern and consider additional factors for my sorting task.

In particular, I notice that the hypernyms in some of these new examples are not the most specific hypernym, but rather a broader category. For instance, "reptile genus" is a broader category than "genus caretta," while "youth subculture" is a broader category than "hipsters

Thank you for the additional examples. From these new examples, I can see that the hypernyms may not always be a direct parent in the taxonomy but can also be a sibling or an ancestor. This suggests that I should consider broader categories as well when sorting the candidate answers for the goal question.

Based on the examples, here are some ways of thinking and helpful information that I can use for the sorting task:

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

Yes. I understand that my goal is to perform link prediction and sorting based on a given goal question and a list of candidate answers. I will sort the candidate answers in the list so that the most likely answers appear prior to less likely ones.
******
The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (evidence, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of evidence? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Yes, I understand that I should carefully read and analyze any examples provided, aiming to identify similarities or relationships that might assist with my sorting task. I will summarize any relevant patterns, concepts, or entities within these examples and commit them to memory. I will remain silent until prompted to proceed with the sorting task.

I understand. By analyzing these examples, the following pattern emerges:

1. A source entity is given, which is connected to a target entity through the relationship of being a _hypernym of (meaning: category or higher-level concept).
2. The objective is to identify the target entity, which is more general and categorical than the source entity, and can be the answer to the question "What is the _hypernym of [source entity]?"

Based on the supplementary information, I observe that:

1. There are cases where the answer entity (testify) is a derivationally_related_form of the given source entity (evidence).
2. The answer entity (evidence) is related to the source entities (attestation, record, statement) through the _hypernym of relationship.
3. In each of the given cases, the answer entity shares a common context or concept with the source entity

The answer is ". The answer is exchange, so the [MASK] is exchange. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
I understand. Based on the new examples, I observe the following patterns:

1. The relationship between the source entity and answer entity concentrates on the more general and broader concept of the source entity, such as switching genus caretta (an animal) to reptile genus or changing hipsters (a specific subculture) to youth subculture.
2. For the given word "piece," the _hypernym of relationship connects it to the answer entity "portion

I continue to observe patterns in the supplementary information:

1. There is a relationship between the derived word and the source, which is testify and evidence. Manifest changes to evidence, indicating a connection between the two words.
2. Testimony and identification are linked to evidence by _hypernym of, further emphasizing the focus on evidence in different contexts. It shows that the word evidence is an important concept and is often connected to related words.

I understand that the word being generalized should be more abstract or broader in terms of concept. The source entity is a specific version or application. The hypernym refers to the word having a more general or abstract meaning.

Based on the analogy, I understand that the process involves discovering the relationship between the more specific term (source entity) and the more general term (answer entity) that shares a broad concept with the source. The hypernym refers to a relationship where the second entity

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I understand that my goal is to perform link prediction and sorting based on a given goal question and a list of candidate answers. I will sort the candidate answers in the list so that the most likely answers appear prior to less likely ones.
******
The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (crosshatch, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of crosshatch? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

I understand. From these examples, I can infer that the task involves predicting the tail entity in a given sentence based on the clue provided in the sentence. In each example, the tail entity is the _derivationally_related_form of the given word. By analogy, I can assume that the goal question is asking for the _derivationally_related_form of the word "crosshatch". To answer this question, I should look for the tail entity

The answer is shade, so the [MASK] is shade. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (hatching, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of hatching? The answer is ". The answer is crosshatch, so the [MASK] is crosshatch. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the supplementary information provided, I now know that the word "crosshatch" is a hypernym of another word and that "hatching" is the derivationally related form of "crosshatch". This helps me to better understand the context of the goal question and the potential relationships between entities. I can use this information to help sort the candidate answers by looking for the _derivationally_related_form of the word "crosshatch".

The answer is ". The answer is think, so the [MASK] is think. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
From these additional examples, I can see that the task involves predicting the derivationally related form of a given word. This helps me to further understand the context of the goal question and the potential answers. By analyzing the given word "crosshatch" and comparing it to the examples, I can see that it does not have a clear derivationally related form like "registrar" or "retrogress". However, I will keep this information in mind as I sort

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (trail, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of trail? The answer is ". The answer is trailer, so the [MASK] is trailer. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (stop over, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of stop over? The answer is ". The answer is stop, so the [MASK] is stop. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (cook, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of cook?

The answer is ". The answer is physical contact, so the [MASK] is physical contact. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on these additional examples, I can see that the derivationally related form of a word can sometimes be the same as the word itself. This reinforces my previous observation that "crosshatch" may not have a clear derivationally related form like some of the other examples. However, I will keep an open mind and consider all possible candidates as I sort the list of answers. I will also look for any potential relationships between the given word "crosshatch" and

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (hold on, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of hold on?

The answer is ". The answer is stabilize, so the [MASK] is stabilize. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
These additional examples suggest that the derivationally related form of a word can sometimes be a form of the same word with a different suffix or prefix. In the case of "hold on" and "mindfulness", the derivationally related form is simply the base word. In the case of "incubate", the derivationally related form is a related noun.

Based on these examples, I will consider all possible forms of the word "crosshatch" as potential

These examples suggest that the derivationally related form of a word can sometimes be a verb form of the same word, or a word with a similar meaning.

Based on these examples, I will consider all possible forms of the word "crosshatch" as potential derivationally-related forms. I will also consider any words with a similar meaning to "crosshatch" as possible answers.

Yes, I will keep these examples in mind and use them to think about the potential relationships and information that may be helpful for the sorting task. The task seems to involve predicting the hypernym of a given entity, and the examples provide a set of contexts where the entity is either an abstract concept, a physical object, or a specific instance of a broader category. By comparing and analyzing these examples, I will look for patterns and cues that can help me to sort the candidate

Yes, I will also consider these additional examples as a useful resource for the sorting task. These examples indicate that the task can involve predicting a hypernym for a specific genus or group, as well as for an individual object or concept. The task may also require identifying the broader domain or category to which the given entity belongs. I will take note of these patterns as I continue to think about the task at hand.

Thank you for providing these additional examples. I will continue to analyze them in order to build a more complete understanding of the sorting task at hand. These examples suggest that the hypernym of a given entity can range from a specific instance of a medical or scientific concept, such as an antibiotic drug, to a broader category of linguistic or semantic relationships, such as a part-whole relation or a performance.

I understand that these new examples show a wider range of hypernyms, from very specific terms, such as "lure," to broader categories, such as "picture show." These examples also demonstrate that the tail entity can sometimes be a single word, while in other cases it may be a multi-word phrase.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I understand that my goal is to perform link prediction and sorting based on a given goal question and a list of candidate answers. I will sort the candidate answers in the list so that the most likely answers appear prior to less likely ones.
******
The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (sterilize, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of sterilize? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.
******
Yes, I understand. I will carefully read, analyze, and understand the given examples, noting any potential relationships or important information. I will then summarize the thinking in these examples and memorize any helpful information to guide my sorting task. I will remain silent until prompted to output the sorted candidate answers.

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (make, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of make? The answer is ". The answer is modify, so the [MASK] is modify. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (physical object, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of physical object? The answer is ". The answer is physical entity, so the [MASK] is physical entity. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (garnet, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of garnet?

******
Based on the given examples, I will try to identify the following relationships and patterns:

1. The first example relates to the hypernym of "make," which is "modify." Since "sterilize" can be considered a more specific form of "modify," I can use this relationship as a possible clue.
2. In the second example, the hypernym of "physical object" is "physical entity." If there is a broader category for "ster

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

Yes. I understand that my goal is to perform link prediction and sorting based on a given goal question and a list of candidate answers. I will sort the candidate answers in the list so that the most likely answers appear prior to less likely ones.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (insisting, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of insisting? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Based on the given examples, I can identify the pattern that the [MASK] position is filled with the hypernym of the entity before [MASK]. To sort the candidate answers for the goal question, I will need to find the hypernym of "insisting" to fill the [MASK] position. Additionally, any supplementary information related to the hypernym of "insisting" may also be helpful for the sorting task. I will keep this pattern and the relationship between the hypernym and

Based on the supplementary information provided in the examples, I will also consider any derivationally related forms of "insisting" to be helpful for the sorting task. Specifically, I will consider the relationship between "insisting" and "insist" and any potential connection to the hypernym of "insisting". By combining the information from both the pattern and the supplementary information, I will be able to sort the candidate answers for the goal question.

Based on the new set of examples provided, I can see that the pattern remains consistent where the [MASK] position is filled with the hypernym of the entity before [MASK]. Additionally, the hypernyms provided in these examples are more specific than the previous examples. This suggests that the sorting task for the goal question will require identifying a hypernym of "insisting" that is also specific and relevant to the context of the question.

From the given examples, I can see that the task involves predicting the tail entity of a given entity by analyzing the relationship between entities. The relationship in this case is defined by the _member_meronym of predicate. I can also see that in each of the examples, the tail entity is a type of the given entity.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I understand that my goal is to perform link prediction and sorting based on a given goal question and a list of candidate answers. I will sort the candidate answers in the list so that the most likely answers appear prior to less likely ones.
******
The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (ulmus carpinifolia, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of ulmus carpinifolia? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Yes. I understand. I will carefully read, analyze, and summarize the given examples, trying to understand the potential meaning of the goal question. I will also mine potential relationships from any supplementary information provided. I will remain silent and only respond when prompted.

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (make, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of make? The answer is ". The answer is modify, so the [MASK] is modify. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (physical object, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of physical object? The answer is ". The answer is physical entity, so the [MASK] is physical entity. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (garnet, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of garnet? The answer is ". The answer is transparent gem, so the [MASK] is transparent gem. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (caudate nucleus, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of caudate nucleus? The answer is ". The answer is basal ganglion, so the [MASK] is basal ganglion. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
From the given examples, I observe that the goal question follows a pattern where the first entity is given, and the task is to predict the hypernym of that entity. The hypernym represents the category or class to which the given entity belongs. I will keep this pattern in mind while performing the sorting task.

Additionally, the given examples contain entities of various domains, such as "make" and "garnet," and their corresponding hypernyms, "modify" and

Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (ulmus, _member_meronym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _member_meronym of ulmus? The answer is ". The answer is ulmus carpinifolia, so the [MASK] is ulmus carpinifolia. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
The supplementary information provided introduces the relation "_member\_meronym of" which implies a part-whole relationship between entities. Given the previous examples, it appears the task requires predicting the hypernym of an entity. However, this new supplementary example suggests that there might be more than one type of relationship between entities in the given examples.

To clarify, I will adhere to the initial pattern and focus on predicting the hypernym of an entity. However, I

Based on the given examples, I notice that the goal question's pattern remains consistent, requiring the prediction of the hypernym for a given entity. The entities involved belong to a wide range of domains, which suggests the importance of understanding the hierarchical relationships in various contexts.

I will continue to analyze further examples and mine potential relationships to aid in the sorting task. Based on my current understanding, I anticipate performing the task as follows:

1. Identify the

The given examples further demonstrate the consistency of the goal question pattern, which is to predict the hypernym for a given entity. The examples depict entities from diverse domains, including biology (jew's-ears, jelly fungus) and medicine (comatoseness, unconsciousness). By examining these examples, I confirm my understanding of the task and emphasize the importance of recognizing hierarchical relationships across different contexts.

1. Display a consistent pattern of predicting the hypernym for a given entity.
2. Cover various domains, like biology, medicine, linguistics, and performance.
3. Include abstract concepts such as "puerility" and "part to whole relation," emphasizing the need for a broad understanding of hierarchical relationships.

With this understanding, I am confident in my ability to sort the candidate answers. I will utilize the given examples

I will use these additional examples to further refine my understanding of the given goal question. From these examples, I can infer that the hypernym of an entity can be a more general category or group to which the entity belongs, as well as a superordinate concept that represents a more abstract or generic version of the entity. In particular, I can use this information to identify hypernyms of "conduct" that represent abstract concepts related to the behavior or actions of entities.

I will not output anything until I am given permission to do so. The way of thinking in the examples could involve analogical reasoning based on the sentence structure and understanding the relationships between the entities mentioned in the examples. Additionally, I will pay attention to any supplementary information that is provided to establish additional relevant relationships.

Understood, I will keep these examples in mind and use them for analogy in order to determine the most likely derivationally related form of the given word "tolerate". Based on these examples, it appears that the missing entity in the goal question should be the derivationally related form of the word "tolerate". Given that the answer is "tolerant", I can use this information to sort the candidate answers accordingly.

Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (allowance, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of allowance? The answer is ". The answer is tolerate, so the [MASK] is tolerate. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (tolerate, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of tolerate?

The answer is tolerance, so the [MASK] is tolerance. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (permit, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of permit?

The answer is ". The answer is permissive, so the [MASK] is permissive. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
I will also take into account the supplementary information provided in the additional examples. From these examples, I can see that "tolerate" is a derivationally related form of "allowance" and "permit", and its related forms include "tolerance" and "permissive". Therefore, I will use this information to help with the sorting task when determining the most likely derivationally related form of "tolerate". This information will supplement the analogy-

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (record, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of record?

******
I understand that in some cases, the answer for the missing entity is a proper noun (e.g. registrar) and in other cases it is a verb (e.g. retrogress). I will also consider this aspect when sorting the candidate answers for the given goal question.

In summary, I'll sort the candidate answers for the goal question in the following way:

1. Perform analogy and determine the relation between the provided word and the missing
******
Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (permit, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of permit? The answer is ". The answer is tolerate, so the [MASK] is tolerate. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (permissive, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of permissive? The answer is ". The answer is tolerate, so the [MASK] is tolerate. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (tolerate, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of tolerate? The answer is ". The answer is permit, so the [MASK] is permit. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (tolerate, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of tolerate? The answer is ". The answer is permit, so the [MASK] is permit. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the previous supplementary information, I'll also consider that "tolerate" is a hypernym of "permit", and its relationship with "permissive" is reciprocal. This information reinforces that the relationship between "tolerate" and "permit" is a two-way relationship. Therefore, when sorting the candidate answers for the goal question, I will prioritize the entity "permit" given its close relationship with "tolerate
******
Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (trail, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of trail? The answer is ". The answer is trailer, so the [MASK] is trailer. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (stop over, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of stop over? The answer is ". The answer is stop, so the [MASK] is stop. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (cook, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of cook? The answer is ". The answer is cook, so the [MASK] is cook. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (touch, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of touch? The answer is ". The answer is physical contact, so the [MASK] is physical contact. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the new analogy examples, I can observe that the relationship between the given word and the missing entity can be either direct derivation (e.g. trail-trailer, stop over-stop) or related by a common concept (e.g. cook-cook, touch-physical contact). This observation will help me consider a broader range of relationships when sorting the candidate answers for the given goal question.

To summarize, I'll keep in mind
******
Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (tolerate, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of tolerate? The answer is ". The answer is permit, so the [MASK] is permit. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the given supplement information, I will consider the relationship between the words "tolerate" and "permit" as being derivationally related forms when sorting the candidate answers for the given goal question. The presence of this information reinforces the close relationship between these two words, and I will prioritize "permit" when determining the most likely derivationally related form of "tolerate".

In summary, when sorting the candidate answers for the given goal

And the question is predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (tolerate, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of tolerate?

From the additional examples, I gather that the hypernym of the given concept can vary in specificity and abstraction. In some cases, the hypernym represents a more specific category, while in other cases, it represents a more general concept.

In general, it seems that the hypernym of the given concept can represent an abstract quality, a relationship, a category, or a subcategory.

Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I understand that my goal is to perform link prediction and sorting based on a given goal question and a list of candidate answers. I will sort the candidate answers in the list so that the most likely answers appear prior to less likely ones.
******
The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (trail, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of trail? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

I have read the examples and understand the ways of thinking in them. In the first example, the answer "effect" is a verb that is derivationally related to "set up". Similarly, in the second example, "misunderstand" is a verb that is derivationally related to "misunderstanding". However, in the third example, "hold" and "concurrency" are not directly related. Instead, "concurrency" is a noun related to the

I have read and understand the supplementary information in the examples. From the second example, a "tracker" is related to "trail" as its derivationally related form. Similarly, in the third example, "chaser" is related to "trail" as its derivationally related form. Finally, in the fourth example, "trail" is a hypernym of "tree". By considering these relationships, I can infer that "trail" is a common denom

From the given examples, I can recognize a relationship between a base word and its derivationally related form. In the first example, "record" and "registrar" are related as derivationally related forms. Similarly, in the second example, "recidivism" and "retrogress" are related as derivationally related forms. In the third example, "nickname" is related to "soubriquet" as its derivationally related form.

From the additional supplementary information given in the examples, I can see that "trailing" and "tailing" are derivationally related to "trail". "Pursuer" is also related to "trail" as a derivationally related form. "Trail" is also a hypernym of "pursue". These relationships can help me understand the potential meanings of the prompts and guide my sorting of candidate answers.

From the previous examples, I have observed that a derivationally related form of a base word can be a verb or noun that is derived from the base word and has a similar meaning. In the first example, "trail" is the base word and "trailer" is a noun that is derived from "trail" and refers to a vehicle or piece of equipment that is pulled by a vehicle. In the second example, "stop over" is the base word and

******
I notice that the examples provide additional context that I can use to improve my sorting task. From the first example, I can infer that "run down" is a specific type of "trail," which suggests that the tail entity should be "trail." In the second example, the base entity is "trail" and its derivationally related form is "tracker," which implies that "tracker" is a type of "trail" or a related concept. Similarly,

From these examples, I can see that the goal is to predict the tail entity in a given sentence by completing it with a word that is the derivationally related form of the base entity. The examples also suggest that the tail entity can be a verb or a noun, and it should have a direct relation with the base entity. For instance, "hol
d" is the derivationally related form of "hold on", and "hold" is the tail entity of the sentence.

Yes, I understand. I will also consider these additional examples in order to better understand the different patterns that may arise in the given sentences and their corresponding answers. Based on these examples, I see that the [MASK] entity is a hypernym of the given entity, but it is also sometimes followed by additional information that clarifies its meaning or narrows its scope. In some cases, the [MASK] entity is a more general category, while in other cases it may be a subcategory or

Yes, I understand. I will also consider these additional examples, which further illustrate the different types of patterns that may arise in these questions. These additional examples suggest that the [MASK] entity may be a more specific category that is still directly related to the given entity, or it may be a more general category that still retains some aspects of the given entity's meaning.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (glade, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of glade? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting.

Understood. I will carefully analyze the provided examples and their solutions to identify any patterns or relationships that may inform the sorting task. Based on the provided examples, it seems that the derivationally-related form of a word often relates to the original word's meaning or use case. I will keep this in mind as I sort the candidate answers.

I see. Based on the supplementary information, it seems that words can have a variety of relationships with each other, such as shared meanings, derivations or hierarchies. In this task, I will need to identify and apply the appropriate relationship to sort the candidate answers correctly, taking into account that the same words might be used in different ways in different contexts.

In the analogical examples provided, the task is to predict the tail entity based on the given relationship and the first entity, and the answer is a single word that forms the tail entity. Looking at the answers, it appears that they are related to the first entity in a way that the second entity is either a derivative form of the first entity, or another word that can be related to the first entity by a specific grammatical or lexical rule. Therefore, in my sorting process

I understand. From the analogical examples provided, it appears that the tail entity is typically related to the given entity by a specific rule, which could be a morphological transformation or a semantic relationship. Also, in some cases, the tail entity is a single word and in other cases, it might be a multi-word expression. Additionally, some entities may be their own derivationally-related form, and physical contact seems to be an exception, where the answer is not a single word

Based on the examples, it appears that the task of predicting the tail entity from a given relationship is often about finding a word that is closely related to the first entity semantically or by a derivational relationship. In the case of "derivationally\_related\_form\_of", the tail entity is often a word that is derived from the first entity in some way, such as through affixation or compounding.

I understand. From the examples provided, I can see the task is to identify the derivationally related form of a given word. The relationship between the words can be the same word itself in some cases, or it could be a verb or an adjective form derived from the original word. The direction of transformation is not always in one way, and it could be both or multi-directional. For example, "calcium" and "calcify" are related bi-direction

I understand. From these examples, it appears that the goal is to predict the tail entity by identifying a derivationally-related form of the given entity. The relationship may involve adding or removing a suffix or prefix, or transforming the word in some other way that signifies its relationship to the tail entity. In some cases, such as "structure" and "reverence", the tail entity and the given entity are the same. In other cases, the tail entity may be a different

Understood, I will keep the examples in mind and think carefully about the patterns and relationships present in them. The first example shows that the _synset\_domain\_topic\_of\_ relation can be used to identify the field or domain to which a given concept belongs.

Thank you for providing the supplementary information. From the second example, it appears that the _hypernym\_ relation can be used to identify more general concepts that encompass the original concept. In this case, the hypernym of "culpable negligence" is "nonperformance". This information may be useful in determining the most likely answer for the _synset\_domain\_topic\_of\_ relation as well.

Based on the additional examples provided, I can see that the _synset\_domain\_topic\_of\_ relation is used to describe the broader domain or field to which a given concept belongs. For instance, the concept "multiply" belongs to the domain "arithmetic", and the concept "cingulum" belongs to the domain "general anatomy". I will keep these examples in mind as I consider the goal question and possible candidates.

Understood. I will carefully analyze the examples given for analogy and infer potential patterns and relationships.

1. In the first example, the _derivationally_related_form of "set up" is "effect," which implies a cause-effect relationship.
2. In the second example, the _derivationally_related_form of "misunderstanding" is "misunderstand," indicating a relationship between a noun and a verb with similar

I understand. I will keep these additional examples in mind, focusing on the following supplementary information:

1. "wellness" and its _derivationally_related_form is "healthy," indicating a positive relationship.
2. The _also_see relationship suggests that "robust" is related to "healthy."
3. The _also_see relationship also indicates that "healthy" is related to "sound."

******
After analyzing the new examples, I understand that the _derivationally_related_form relationship may indicate a connection to related professions, actions, or synonyms:

1. For "record," its _derivationally_related_form is "registrar," possibly because it is a term that manages records.
2. The term "recidivism" shares the same root as "retrogress." Although the exact relationship is unclear

From the given supplementary information:

1. The _derivationally_related_form between "healthiness" and "healthy" signifies that "healthy" is a base form linked to health-related terms.

Based on the new examples, I observe that the _derivationally_related_form relationship may represent a transformation or an action:

1. "trail" and "trailer" demonstrate a relationship of primary object and associated accessory.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

Yes. I understand that my goal is to perform link prediction and sorting based on a given goal question and a list of candidate answers. I will sort the candidate answers in the list so that the most likely answers appear prior to less likely ones.
******
The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (pea family, _member_meronym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _member_meronym of pea family? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Based on the supplementary information provided in the examples, I understand that the relationships described in the goal question might not necessarily be direct. For instance, the member meronym of a family can also be a subfamily of that family. Therefore, I will sort the candidate answers for the goal question while keeping in mind the possibility of multiple levels of hierarchy. I will consider answers at different levels in this hierarchy, and will prioritize those that have a more direct relationship with the "pea family"

The additional analogous examples emphasize that the answer to the goal question might be a subcategory of the given category. For instance, the member meronym of "tentaculata" is "order cestida." This suggests that I should prioritize subcategories or specific instances of the "pea family" when sorting the candidate answers for the goal question. This includes subfamilies, genera, and species that belong to the pea family. I will also consider

I understand that from the supplementary examples, in order to find the correct hypernym of the given entity, it is important to identify the specific relationship between the given entity and its hypernym. In this instance, "hematemesis" is a type of "vomiting," thus the hypernym is "vomiting."
