You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

Yes. I understand my responsibility to perform link prediction and sorting of candidate answers to the given goal question, with the goal of ordering the candidate answers in a way that those which are more likely to be correct appear prior in the list.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (phylum entoprocta, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word phylum entoprocta? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

******
Understood. After carefully reviewing the examples, a pattern has emerged where the [MASK] in the sentence is being replaced with a broader category of the given entity. In the first example, the word "make" is replaced with "modify" since the former is a broader category of the latter. Similarly, in the second example, "physical object" is replaced with "physical entity," which is a more general category. This pattern suggests that the goal question should be answered by

Based on the additional information, it appears that the task involves finding a more general category of a given entity, possibly based on some relation. In the latest example, the given entity is "polyzoa" and it is related to the answer "phylum entoprocta" as a member of it. Therefore, it is clear that the task requires using the given relation and entity to find a more general category that fits within the context of the given examples. Furthermore, it is

Understood. The task requires me to predict the tail entity by finding a more general category or hypernym that is related to the given entity. The given entity can be a genus, a group of people, or a specific object, and the broad category or hypernym can be a reptile genus, a youth subculture, a portion, or an exchange, respectively. I should use this pattern to determine the tail entity from the given relation and entity, in this case, (ph

Based on the additional examples, the pattern appears consistent, with the tail entity being a hypernym that is a broader category of the given entity, even in cases where the given entity is a word in a more specialized field, such as "jew's-ears" being a "jelly fungus" or "hydrogen carbonate" being a "carbonate." This shows that the tail entity is likely to be a more general category of the given entity in most,

Understood, I will keep these additional examples in mind while I think about how to sort the candidate answers for the original goal question.
From these examples, it seems that the hypernym is a more general concept than the given entity and can refer to a class or group of similar entities.

From the examples used in analogy, it is clear that the goal is to predict a hypernym, or a broader category, for the given term. In the first example, "sorrow" belongs to the broader category of "unhappiness." In the second example, "muharram" is a month in the "Islamic calendar month." The task involves finding a similar hypernym relation between a given term and the mask in the prompt.

Understood, I will memorize the information and way of thinking from these examples:

* From "abortionist -> physician", "suspect -> venture", I learn that the task may require identifying a hypernym that could be a broader category of the given term.

Based on the supplementary information provided in the examples, I noted that the word "position" has several relationships with other words, such as being a hypernym of "station" and "setting", having a derivationally related form "position", and being a broader category of "lie". Therefore, if the first entity in the tuple is "position", the more likely hypernym or broader category would be "position" itself.

Yes, I'm still considering the additional examples. For instance, the answer for "collage film" being "picture show" tells me that I could look for the general concept under which the given word falls, and similarly, for "fisherman's lure" being "lure", "diesel locomotive" being "railway locomotive", and "yelling" being "yell".

I understand the analogy from these examples. You expect me to find the broader category for a given entity. In this case, "sorrow" belongs to "unhappiness", "muharram" is an "islamic calendar month", "subcontract" is a "hire", and "parallelize" is a "set". I consider these clues as well as all the previous ones to help me perform the requested sorting for the goal question.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

Yes. I understand my responsibility to perform link prediction and sorting of candidate answers to the given goal question, with the goal of ordering the candidate answers in a way that those which are more likely to be correct appear prior in the list.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (lexicology, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a word derivated from the word lexicology? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

I understand that the goal is to predict the tail entity in a given sentence that is the derivationally related form of a given word. The sorted list of candidate answers will depend on my ability to infer the correct related form of the given word in the goal question.

From the given examples, I will keep in mind that the related form of a word is often a derivative that demonstrates a direct semantic relationship with the original word. For example, the related form of "set up

I understand that the related form of a word can be derived from the original word by a variety of means, including but not limited to adding prefixes or suffixes. The related form could also be a semantic variation of the original word, as demonstrated in the example for "misunderstanding".

Additionally, I will consider the possibility that the related form of a word may be a synonym or near synonym of the original word, as seen in the example for "think

From these additional analogies, I will also consider the possibility that the related form of a word may be a word or phrase that is closely associated with the original word in meaning. For example, "stop" is the related form of "stop over" as it is the action directly related to the original word.

Also, in cases where the original word may already be a derivation (such as "trailer"), I will consider the possibility that the related form could simply be

From the provided examples, I can observe that the tail entity of the input tuple is often a derivative of the given word, which can be obtained by removing suffixes or prefixes from the given word or modifying it in some way. For instance, in the example where the given word is "mindfulness," the derivative word is "mindful," which appears to have been created by removing the suffix "-ness" from the given word. In another example, the given word "incubate

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

Yes. I understand my responsibility to perform link prediction and sorting of candidate answers to the given goal question, with the goal of ordering the candidate answers in a way that those which are more likely to be correct appear prior in the list.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (sops, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a word derivated from the word sops? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Yes, I will carefully read and consider the provided examples to understand the potential meaning of the goal question and to identify any patterns or relationships that may be helpful in sorting the candidate answers. I will summarize the thinking and memorize the relevant information for use in the sorting task. I will remain silent while awaiting the examples.

From the provided examples, I gather that the tail entity in the masked position should be a word that is derivationally related to, and is derived from, the given entity. In the first two examples, the answers are simple derivations: "effect" is derived from "set up" and "misunderstand" is derived from "misunderstanding". The third example, however, introduces concurrency, which is a bit more complex as it is not a single-

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (thunder, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word thunder? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Understood, I will keep these additional examples in mind while considering the main task. It seems that the hypernyms can be at different granularity levels, from higher ones (e.g. "youth subculture", "reptile genus") down to lower ones (e.g. "portion", "exchange"). I will consider this variation in granularity when performing the sorting task for the given [thunder, hypernym of, [MASK]]

Understood, I'll keep these examples in mind as well, where the given entity is a specific instance within its broader category. Here the task is to predict the category and not the immediate parent node of the given entity.

To summarize my understanding, my task is to:
- predict the broad category (can be a hypernym at varying levels of abstraction) of the given entity
- using the information provided in the main question, and any additional examples given.

Understood, using all these examples, I realize that the hypernyms predicted can be at different abstraction levels, ranging from broader categories to subtypes of the given entities. 
Additionally, not just the hierarchical but in some cases thematic or functional relationships are expected to be recognized and predicted. I'm now ready to perform the sorting task as instructed.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I understand my responsibility to perform link prediction and sorting of candidate answers to the given goal question, with the goal of ordering the candidate answers in a way that those which are more likely to be correct appear prior in the list.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (grant, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word grant? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Understood. I will carefully read and study the examples related to the goal question, and use analogical reasoning to understand the potential meaning of the question. I will also pay attention to any supplementary information given in the examples and mine for potential relationships among them to assist in the sorting task. I will remain silent and wait for your signal before outputting any information.

Understood. I will keep these examples in mind as I perform analogical reasoning to understand the goal question. Based on these examples, it appears that the aim is to predict the hypernym of the given term, or a broader category in the taxonomy to which the given term belongs. This is inferred from the fact that the answer in each example is a hypernym of the given term. I will use this information to guide my sorting of the candidate answers.

Understood. I will also take into account the supplementary information provided in the examples. From the first two examples, it is clear that the word "grant" can be a derivationally related form of itself, which suggests that the given term can sometimes be the answer to the question.

The third example shows that "grant" can be a hypernym of "grant-in-aid", which is similar to the goal question. This suggests that in this case,

Noted. I will take note of this analogy: to fill in the blank with the hypernym of the given entity that forms a broader category of it. For example, for a collage film, its hypernym or broader category is a picture show; a fisherman's lure is a type of lure, and yelling is a type of yell. A diesel locomotive can be classified as a railway locomotive. I will keep these examples in mind

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (hostility, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a word derivated from the word hostility? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

From the examples provided, I understand that the task is to predict the tail entity in a sentence that can be derived from a given root word. The tail entity is expected to be a word that is derivationally related to the root word provided. I can use this understanding and apply it to the goal question, in order to predict the tail entity that is derivationally related to the root word "hostility". Additionally, I can use the given examples to infer relationships and patterns between the root

From the supplemental information provided, I understand that the root word "hostility" can be related to other concepts such as "plundering" and "violence" as a hyponym. Additionally, I understand that "hostility" is a hyponym of the broader category "action". These relationships and patterns can be used to infer connections between the root word "hostility" and potential tail entities, and to help predict the tail entity that is derivationally related to "

From the additional examples, I understand that the task of predicting the tail entity can include cases where the root word and the tail entity share a derivational relationship in both directions, meaning that the root word can be derived from the tail entity and vice versa. This can help me infer possible relationships and predict potential tail entities for "hostility" by finding words that share a similar derivational relationship with it. Additionally, I can also consider cases where the root word and tail entity do not share

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (york, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word york? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting.

Thank you for providing these analogy examples. They suggest a pattern of hypernymy, where the goal is to find a candidate answer that is a more general or broader category than the given entity.

From these examples, I will also keep in mind that the candidate answer should be a single word or a single phrase. In addition,

Thank you for providing the supplementary information. Based on this new example, it seems that the hypernymy relationship can sometimes be quite broad, encompassing entities that may not seem directly related to the given entity at first. In this example, "royalty" does not seem to be a direct hypernym of "york," but upon further reflection, one could argue that the royal family or monarchy is a broader category or aspect of the city of York.

I will keep in mind the latest examples provided while I continue to think. From these additional examples, it's becoming clearer that the hypernym may be an abstract concept or a broader category that encompasses the given entity.

At the same time, it seems that the given entity can be a specific instance or a lower-level concept in the hierarchy, and the hypernym could be its parent or ancestor concept in the same hierarchy.

The relationship between the given entity

From these new examples, I notice that the hypernym can be a more specific or narrower concept than the given entity. For instance, in the case of "jew's-ears," the hypernym "jelly fungus" is a more specific category that encompasses the given entity.

Similarly, in the example "motorization," the hypernym "implementation" is a more general concept that includes various forms of implementation, including motorization.

These additional examples suggest that the hypernym could also refer to a broader category that encompasses more than just one specific level of granularity.

Based on the new examples, it's clear that the broader category of a word or concept can also be a more specific category or level within the hierarchy of hypernyms.

From these examples, it seems that the relationship between the given entity and the hypernym can range from a more specific instance to a broader category, and that the answer could be a single word or a phrase depending on the level of specificity.

These additional examples reinforce the idea that the hypernym of a word can be a more general category or class that encompasses the given word and its associated concepts.

In the case of "abortionist," the hypernym "physician" represents a broader category of medical professionals who are licensed to practice medicine. Similarly, in the case of "suspect," the hypernym "venture" could refer to a broader category of risk-taking behaviors or undertakings.

These examples suggest that the relationship between the given entity and the broader category can be quite varied. In some cases, the broader category is a more general term that applies to a wide range of concepts (such as "change" in the example "modernize"). In other cases, the broader category is a more specific term that applies to a narrower range of concepts, such as "spirituality" in the example "ecclesiastical benefice."

It seems like the broader category for a given entity can be a higher-level concept, a supercategory, or an action that represents a broader concept of the given word. For example, in the case of "freeze," the broader category is "put under," which represents a broader concept of restricting or changing the state of something. Similarly, in the case of "expensiveness," the broader category is "price," which represents a broader concept of cost or value.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (sterilize, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word sterilize?

Understood. I will keep these examples in mind and think about how they can aid in the sorting task. Based on the given examples, it seems that the missing [MASK] entities are all hypernyms, or broader categories, of the starting terms. Therefore, for the given question, the [MASK] should be a hypernym of the word "sterilize". Moreover, it is likely that the answer should be a general process or action category, given that the word "ster

Noted. These additional examples provide valuable insights on the usage of the "_derivationally\_related\_form" relationship. It seems that this relationship indicates that the filling [MASK] should be a derivationally related form of the given term. In the case of the word "sterilize", we have previously established that it is the starting term and the [MASK] should be its hypernym. From the provided examples, "sterilize" can be related to "steril

******
Understood. Based on these additional examples, it appears that the hypernym [MASK] is a broader category of the starting term, and in some cases, it can be a less specific noun or verb. For instance, the hypernym of "break" is "exchange", which suggests a transition to a more general verb category. Furthermore, the distinction between reptile genus and turtle species implies a higher level of specificity for certain cases.

Understood, I will keep these additional examples in mind. Based on these examples, I can see that the hypernym [MASK] can be a broader category with different levels of abstraction for different terms.

Understood. These examples suggest the hypernym [MASK] can be an even broader or more abstract category of the starting term. For instance, puerility is a category of immaturity, while part to whole relation is a semantic relation. Neomycin is a specific type of antibiotic drug, while trick is a component of a performance. The relationships suggested in these examples offer some guidance for determining the hypernym [MASK] for the given task.

Understood, I will keep these additional examples in mind. In these examples, the hypernym [MASK] can be either a broader category or an abstraction of the starting term.

Understood, I will take note of these examples as well. Similar to the previous examples, these suggest that the hypernym [MASK] is a broader category of the starting term.

Understood, I will deeply consider these additional examples as well to make the connections even clearer. In all these examples, the [MASK] is a hypernym of the starting term and a more general, broader category, like how "physician" is a broader category than "abortionist," and "structure" is broader than "tower."

Understood. The goal question and the given examples both require predicting the hypernym or broader category of a given entity.

For the goal question, I will predict the hypernym of the entity "[MASK]" in the statement "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word field event? The answer is [MASK]."

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I understand my responsibility to perform link prediction and sorting of candidate answers to the given goal question, with the goal of ordering the candidate answers in a way that those which are more likely to be correct appear prior in the list.
******
The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (monster, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word monster? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Yes, I understand. I will carefully read and analyze the given examples, looking for patterns, analogies, and supplementary information that can help me with the sorting task. I will summarize the key insights and memorize any relevant information that can aid me in predicting the tail entity in the given masked sentence and sorting the candidate answers according to the goal question. I will remain silent until you signal me to output.

******
I understand. From these examples, I can see that the task involves predicting a hypernym or a broader category for a given entity. In the first example, "make" is a more specific concept, and the hypernym or broader category is "modify." Similarly, in the second example, "physical object" is a specific concept, and the broader category is "physical entity." In the third and fourth examples, "garnet" and "caudate nucleus

******
I see. From these additional examples, I can further infer that the task continues to involve predicting a hypernym or broader category for a given entity. The first new example shows that the entity "genus caretta," referring to a specific type of sea turtle, has a broader category of "reptile genus." The second new example indicates that "hipsters," a particular youth subculture, can be more generally categorized as a "youth subculture."

In these new examples, I can observe the following:

* "Jew's-ears" belongs to the category "jelly fungus," which is a broader term for various gelatinous fungi.
* "Motorization" can be categorized as an "implementation," indicating its broader sense of carrying out an action or process.
* "Hydrogen carbonate" can be classified under "carbonate," representing its chemical composition (b

Understood, here are my summarized thoughts on the given examples:

* In each example, we are predicting the tail entity that can be derived from the given word.
* The tail entity is a word that is derived from the given word, or a word that is formed by a particular transformation of the given word.
* The process of deriving a word typically involves adding a suffix, prefix, or combining the word with another word.
* In the given examples,

Based on the additional examples provided, I have made the following observations to inform the sorting task:

* The tail entity can be derived from the given word through a derivational relationship, as in the previous set of examples.
* But, the tail entity can also be a hypernym of the given word, meaning it is a broader category to which the given word belongs.
* This information suggests that the sorting task should consider both the derivational and hypernym relationships between words

Given these new examples, there are some additional insights to consider for the sorting task:

* The derivational relationship between words in the newly provided examples is a one-to-one mapping, similar to the previous examples with the derivational relationship between words being a suffix or prefix.
* In these examples, the words share a common pattern, for instance, the word "record" relates to "registrar," "stylize" relates to "vogue,"

Based on the new examples, I can see that the relationship between words in the tuples can represent a single step or multiple steps in the derivational process of forming a word.

* For instance, the word "conventionalization" can be related to the word "stylize" in a multi-step derivational process.
* On the other hand, the word "stylization" is a single step derivational form of the word "stylize".

These new examples also suggest that:

* The relationship can also be multi-directional, where a word can be derived from two or more words.
* Moreover, the words in the relationship can be connected using a hyphen, as in "stabilization" and "stabilize". This new information

From the given examples and the description of the task, I understand that I need to use past experiences and patterns to predict the tail entity, based on the given head entity and relationship type. I should take into account all available information, including any additional context provided in the goal question or examples.

From these examples, I have observed the following pattern:

* The tail entity is a word that can be derived from the head entity
* Even if the head entity is already a word, there is still an opportunity to derive another word from it
* The relationship is always derivationally\_related\_form, indicating the tail entity is a result of modifying the head entity.

I will use this pattern to predict the tail entities given the goal question.

After analyzing the new examples given, I have understood that the derivationally related form can result in nouns or adjectives from the head entity, and some of the derivational forms can be multi-layered, where a word can give more than one word as a tail entity.

In the first example, the word reverence is related to the word reverent. In the second example, promote is related to promotion. In the third example, pollute is related

These new examples demonstrate that the derivationally\_related\_form relationship may not always result in a new word, as shown in the bed and notch examples where the answer is the same as the given word.

Moreover, it is also possible to have a word that has multiple derivationally\_related\_form words, as in the unify example where the answer is mixture, whereas the weeping example answers with cry.

From these examples, I infer that the relationship between the given word and the tail entity can be in the form of a direct derivative, whether it be a suffix like -ed or through a more complex process like the derivation of vitality from stimulate.

Understood, I will keep these additional examples in mind and note the relation between hypernymy and derivation where appropriate. The supplementary examples demonstrate that the [MASK] entity can also refer to words that are derivationally related to the given word, which means they are connected to the given word by a specific kind of relationship where one word is modified from another. I will consider both hypernymy and derivational relationships between words when analyzing the given question and sorting the candidate answers

I will also consider these additional examples, where the given word is associated with a broader category or a hypernym that may be more abstract than the original word, and which is not a direct superclass of the given word in the hierarchical taxonomy. This implies that the model could consider domain knowledge or common sense relationships in order to provide the correct hypernym. It is important to keep these relationships in mind when sorting the candidate answers.

Yes. I understand my responsibility to perform link prediction and sorting of candidate answers to the given goal question, with the goal of ordering the candidate answers in a way that those which are more likely to be correct appear prior in the list.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (plus, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word plus? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.

Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Understood. The supplementary information provided in these examples reinforces the idea that the answer to the [MASK] position will be "plus" in each case. This suggests that the topic of the goal question and these examples is related to the category of "plus," which is likely to be a broader category that encompasses a variety of different entities. This information can help me to focus on answer options that fit within the category of "plus" or that are commonly associated with it.

Understood, I will keep thinking about these additional examples and how they can help me to further refine my approach to sorting the candidate answers to the goal question. The analogy suggests that the correct answer to the [MASK] position can be a broader category for the given entity. In order to determine the correct answer, one can consider the hierarchy of categories for the given entity and identify the most specific category that fits within the broader category given as the answer option.

These additional examples further illustrate the pattern where the correct answer to the [MASK] position can be a broader category for the given entity, in this case, for entities such as Jew's ear, motorization, hydrogen carbonate, and comatoseness.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I understand my responsibility to perform link prediction and sorting of candidate answers to the given goal question, with the goal of ordering the candidate answers in a way that those which are more likely to be correct appear prior in the list.
******
The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (glade, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a word derivated from the word glade? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Understood. I will carefully read and analyze the given examples, including those that are similar to the goal question to understand its potential meaning, and I will also capture and mine potential relationships from any supplementary information given. I will memorize any information that I think may be helpful to my sorting task and remain silent while the examples are being provided.

Understood, I will keep these examples in mind while analyzing them and mining potential relationships to the goal question. From these examples, I can observe that the tail entity is often the base word itself, as in the case of "effect" for the head word "set up" and "misunderstand" for the head word "misunderstanding". However, there are also cases where the tail entity is a new word formed through a process of derivation, such as "con

I understand that these examples suggest that the tail entity can often be a word that is related to the base word in a way that indicates the origin, source or the process implied.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (warping, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word warping? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

I understand the analogy examples provided. From the given examples, it can be inferred that the tail entity [MASK] in the goal question can be completed by predicting a word that is derivationally related to the given top entity. The derivationally related word should be a noun, verb or adjective, which has a direct semantic relationship with the top entity and that can form a grammatical and meaningful expression when combined with it. Moreover, though the words in

From the second set of examples provided, it can be observed that the top entity can have different relationships with the tail entity. In the first and second examples, the top entity "top" has a derivationally related form, which remains the same as the top entity for the answer "top" and changes to "upside" for the answer "upside". In the third example, the top entity "top" is used in a broader hypernym category relation, where the tail entity becomes

These examples further showcase the relationship between the top entity and the tail entity, where the tail entity can be a derivationally related form of the top entity. The examples suggest that the tail entity can be a word derived from the top entity by removing a suffix or a prefix, as in the cases of "hold on" and "hold", "mindfulness" and "mindful", "incubate" and "incubator".
