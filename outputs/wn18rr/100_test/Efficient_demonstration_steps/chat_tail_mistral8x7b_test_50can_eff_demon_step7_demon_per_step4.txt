You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I can help you perform link prediction and sort the candidate answers in order of likelihood to be the correct answer to the given question.
******
The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (suborder blattodea, _member_meronym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _member_meronym of suborder blattodea? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Yes, I understand. I will carefully read and analyze the examples provided, looking for patterns, relationships, and any other relevant information that may help me perform link prediction and sort the candidate answers for the goal question: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (suborder blattodea, _member_meronym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _member_meronym of suborder blattodea?"

I will summarize the

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (megapodiidae, _member_meronym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _member_meronym of megapodiidae? The answer is ". The answer is macrocephalon, so the [MASK] is macrocephalon. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (sumac family, _member_meronym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _member_meronym of sumac family?

Based on these examples, I can see a pattern emerging:

* In the first example, the given fact is "(megapodiidae, _member_meronym of , [MASK])", and the answer is "macrocephalon". This suggests that the blank should be filled with "macrocephalon" as well, which is a member of "megapodiidae".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (position, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of position? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting.

Thank you for the extra examples. From these examples, it seems like the "has\_part" relationship can also refer to a self-contained entity. For instance, in the first example, a squid is a self-contained entity that is composed of various parts, one of which is the squid itself. Similarly, the Republic of Latvia is a self-contained entity that has Riga as one of its parts.

From the given supplement information, I can see that the general entity "chromosome" is being connected to two different types of relations, one being "has\_part of" and the other being "hypernym of". The first relation-specific example clarifies that the [MASK] entity in this context is "kinetochore". This helps in understanding that the ["has\_part of" relation indicates a directional association from a general entity "chromosome" to specific

******
Based on the new analogy examples given, I can see that there is a pattern emerging between the "has\_part of" relation and specific parts of different entities. In both the new examples and the previous ones, the "has\_part of" relation connects a general entity to a more specific component or phase. This further solidifies the understanding that the missing entity in the goal question is the specific part or component of a chromosome.

******
The additional supplementary information reinforces the understanding that the "has\_part of" relation can connect the general entity "chromosome" to specific components or features, such as "nucleolus organizer" or "gene".

******
The analogy examples provided further emphasize the relation of the general entity being connected to a specific part or component. The first example uses "tabooli" and the "has\_part of" relation to indicate "bulgur wheat". Similarly, the second example shows "ocean liner" and "has\_part of" relation to indicate "cabin". The goal question, using the same format, requires a specific part or component of the general entity "chromosome

The answer is ". The answer is chromosome, so the [MASK] is chromosome. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
The additional supplementary information reinforces the connection between entities and their parts, specifically between a nucleus and its chromosomes.

Yes. I can help you perform link prediction and sort the candidate answers in order of likelihood to be the correct answer to the given question.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (accentuation, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of accentuation? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting.

Based on the provided examples, it appears that the goal question follows a similar format, where the task is to predict the hypernym of a given entity. In the first example, the entity is "make", and the correct hypernym is "modify", resulting in the completed sentence "what is the hypernym of make? modify". In the second example, the entity is "physical object", and the correct hypernym is "physical entity", resulting in the completed sentence "what is

******
From the supplementary information given, I understand that the relationship between some of the entities is not only of hypernym but also of derivationally related form. Specifically, "accentuation" and "stress" appear to be derivationally related, meaning that they are related through a transformation in form such as a prefix or suffix addition or deletion.

This new information strengthens my understanding of the goal question and may be helpful in the sorting process, as it suggests

In addition to the previous examples, these new analogies further illustrate the relationship between the entities and their hypernyms. In the first example, the entity is "genus caretta", which is a specific genus of animals belonging to the broader category of "reptile genus". In the second example, the entity is "hipsters", which is a subculture of young people, or a "youth subculture".

Upon further consideration of these last two examples, I note that the relationship between the entities and their hypernyms is not strictly one of hypernymy in the traditional sense. Instead, these examples demonstrate the relationship of the entities to more general categories, or broader concepts, that are still relevant to the sorting process for the candidate answers.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I can help you perform link prediction and sort the candidate answers in order of likelihood to be the correct answer to the given question.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (lexicology, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of lexicology? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

From the examples provided, I understand that I should predict the tail entity ([MASK]) in the given sentence by identifying the derivationally related form of the first entity (lexicology in this case). The examples suggest that the tail entity should be related to the given word (lexicology) in a way that they share a common derivational relationship.

I will memorize this thinking and analyze the given word to find its derivationally related form. Based on the learned pattern

Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (lexicology, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of lexicology? The answer is ". The answer is philology, so the [MASK] is philology. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (lexicologist, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of lexicologist? The answer is ". The answer is lexicology, so the [MASK] is lexicology. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
I will also consider any supplementary information given, such as the additional examples provided. These examples help me understand the concept of a hypernym and its relation to the provided question. It shows that the tail entity should be a hypernym of the first entity (lexicology).

Similarly, the information about the derivationally related form of "lexicologist" is helpful, as it demonstrates another relationship I might encounter. Based on this, I will keep this information in mind

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (hold, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of hold?

The answer is ". The answer is parcelling, so the [MASK] is parcelling. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
The new examples introduce a new type of relationship, where the tail entity is not a direct derivation of the given word. Instead, the tail entity is a form of an action or state derived from the given word, as in the case of "hold" and "concurrency". I need to analyze the given word and find the corresponding action, state, or concept associated with it.

I will remember this analogy and try to apply it to the provided question, looking for an action

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (record, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of record?

The answer is ". The answer is retrogress, so the [MASK] is retrogress. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
The last pair of examples shows that the relationship can also be a noun derived from the given word, as in the case of "record" and "registrar". I must consider different noun forms that are related to the given word and search for a relationship.

In the second example, "recidivism" is a noun and the tail entity "retrogress" is a verb related to the given word, meaning "to relapse". I need to be

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (nickname, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of nickname?

******
The last pair of examples contradicts the previous pattern where the relationship was an action or state derived from the given word. In this case, the tail entity and given word are the same, meaning that there is no derivational relationship between the two entities.

I will remember this new pattern and consider whether there is any relationship between the given word and the tail entity. If not, the tail entity will be the same as the given word.

With these examples in mind, I will

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (trail, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of trail?

******
The new examples introduced a new pattern, where the tail entity is a verb or a noun that means a single occurrence of the given word. For example, the word "trail" has a derived related form as "trailer", which refers to a single occurrence of a "trail".

Similarly, "stop over" and "stop" are related, where "stop over" is a noun that refers to a temporary stop and "stop" is the

The answer is ". The answer is physical contact, so the [MASK] is physical contact. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
The last pair of examples show a more complex derivationally related form, where the tail entity is not a single word but a noun phrase derived from the given verb. The tail entity in this case is a specific meaning of the verb. In the example, "touch" means a physical contact between two objects or elements.

In summary, while trying to identify the derivationally related form of a given word, we must consider various types of relationships, such as noun or verb

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (hold on, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of hold on?

The answer is hold, so the [MASK] is hold. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (mindfulness, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of mindfulness? The answer is ". The answer is mindful, so the [MASK] is mindful. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
The first example has a simple relationship, where the tail entity is the verb form of the given phrase "hold on" which is "hold".

The second example has a different relationship, where the tail entity is the adjective form of the given noun "mindfulness" which is "mindful". This shows that we have to consider the grammatical form of the tail entity based on the given word or phrase.

In summary, the relationship between the given word or

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (incubate, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of incubate?

The answer is ". The answer is stabilize, so the [MASK] is stabilize. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the given examples, we can see that the derivationally related form of a word refers to a related word that can be obtained by a variety of linguistic processes, such as:

* Prefix or suffix addition: e.g., incubate--incubator, stabilization--stabilize
* Changing the word's part of speech: e.g., mindfulness--mindful
* Retaining the core meaning: e.g., le

From the given examples, we can observe that the derivationally related form is the word that is formed by:

* Changing the grammatical category (part of speech) of the given word, e.g., "structure" to "structuring"
* Adding or removing a prefix or suffix to the given word, e.g., "calcium" to "calcify".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (vanish, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of vanish? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Thank you for the examples. From these examples, I can infer that the goal is to predict the derivationally related form of a given word. Therefore, I should look for candidates in the list of answers that are derivationally related to the given word "vanish". Additionally, I can use the analogy formed by the examples to determine the correct answer. For instance, if the answer is a verb, then it is likely the correct answer. I will keep this in mind while sort

Thank you for the additional examples with supplementary information. From these examples, I can infer that the words "vanish" and "fade" are derivationally related to each other, and the relationship is reciprocal. This means that if "fade" is the derivationally related form of "vanish", then "vanish" is also the derivationally related form of "fade". This is an important relationship to keep in mind while sorting the candidate answers

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (brasov, _instance_hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _instance_hypernym of brasov? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

******
Thank you for sharing the examples. Based on these analogies, it seems that the goal question is also asking for the hypernym of the given entity. Therefore, for the goal question "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (coelenterate family, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence 'what is the _hypernym of coelenterate family?'," I should be looking for the hypernym of "coelenterate family."

******
Thank you for the additional examples. I will use this information to inform my understanding of the relationships between the given entities. Based on these examples, I now know that both "kingdom animalia" and "pennatulidae" are related to "coelenterate family" through the relationships "member meronym of" and "hypernym of" respectively. These relationships suggest that "coelenterate family" is a more specific category of animals that falls within the broader category of

The answer is ". The answer is basal ganglion, so the [MASK] is basal ganglion. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
The additional analogies provided demonstrate that the goal question is asking for a hypernym of "coelenterate family" and that this hypernym will likely be a more general term encompassing this family of animals. These examples also support the chain of relationships established in the earlier examples, where "coelenterate family" was identified as a specific category within the kingdom animalia. This information reinforces the need to identify a more general term as the hypernym of "coelenter

The additional analogies show that the hypernym of the given entity can be identified by a more general term, which is a broader category that encompasses the given entity. For example, in the first analogy, "genus caretta" is a type of "reptile genus," and in the second analogy, "hipsters" are a type of "youth subculture."

These additional analogies suggest that the hypernym of the given entity is a more general term that encompasses its meaning. In the first example, a "piece" is a specific term that refers to a part of a larger whole, and the hypernym "portion" refers to a similar idea. Similarly, in the second example, a "break" is a specific term that refers to a pause or temporary cessation, and the hypernym "exchange" refers to a more

******
These analogies suggest that the task of predicting the tail entity of a given entity and its hypernym requires looking for a broader concept that encompasses the meaning of the given entity.

Understood. The goal is to find the hypernym of the given entity, the most general class or category that the given entity falls under.

For tasks like this, it can be helpful to first understand the given entity and then identify its broader category. In the case of "puerility," the given hypernym is "immaturity," so "puerility" refers to a specific type of immaturity. Similarly, for the to-part whole relation, the given

******
These examples demonstrate that the hypernym can sometimes be a more general or abstract concept, such as a semantic relation as opposed to a specific type of semantic relation. I will keep this in mind while sorting the candidate answers, as the answer I am looking for may be a more abstract or general concept.

In the first example, "puerility" is a type of "immaturity", which is a more general or abstract concept that indicates a lack of maturity or

These examples further illustrate that the hypernym can be a more general or abstract concept, even if the given entity is itself very specific. "Neomycin" is a type of "antibiotic drug", and "trick" is a type of "performance", indicating that the answer can be more general than the given entity.

I will remember this pattern when sorting the candidate answers, and consider whether the given entity belongs to a more specific category of the hypernym

I understand these additional analogy examples provided. The first example appears to introduce an exception to the previously identified pattern, as the answer "concurrency" is not the base form of "hold". The second example reinforces the concept of the _derivationally_related_form relationship and the idea that the tail entity is a form of the given word.

To sort the candidate answers, I will consider both the base form and possible derivationally related forms of the given word

Yes, I understand. I will carefully read and study the given examples, analyzing any similarities or analogies to the goal question and extracting supplementary information. I will then use this knowledge to inform my approach to sorting the candidate answers in a way that prioritizes those most likely to be correct.

Thank you for the examples. Based on these analogies, it seems that the task involves predicting the hypernym of a given entity. Given the goal question, it appears that I will need to predict the hypernym of "field event" and sort the candidate answers accordingly. The first example suggests that the hypernym of "make" is "modify," so if "field event" were replaced with "make" in the given sentence, the correct hypernym would be "modify."

Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (track meet, _has_part of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _has_part of track meet? The answer is ". The answer is field event, so the [MASK] is field event. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
Thank you for the additional information. This example indicates that "field event" is a component of a "track meet." This suggests that "field event" might be a more specific term than the hypernym I am being asked to predict in the goal question. This information helps me further refine my understanding of the task and will be useful in sorting the candidate answers.

Thank you for the additional analogies. These examples suggest that the hypernym of a given entity may be a more general term that encompasses the original entity, as well as other similar entities. In the first example, "transparent gem" is a more general term that includes "garnet." Similarly, in the second example, "basal ganglion" is a more general term that includes "caudate nucleus."

Thank you for the additional analogies. These examples suggest that the hypernym of a given entity may be a more general term that reflects the broader category or classification to which the entity belongs. For example, "genus caretta" is a specific reptile genus, while "hipsters" are a specific type of youth subculture. These examples suggest that I should look for a hypernym of "field event" that reflects a broader category or classification of this entity. I will keep

Understood, I will keep these examples in mind and look for patterns that involve hypernyms in the given examples. Based on these examples, it seems that the task is to predict the hypernym of the first entity (order casuarinales) based on the provided sentence.

Yes, I understand that the _derivationally\_related\_form of the word "style" is "stylize", which means to give a particular style to something. The example also further illustrates that when trying to predict the tail entity from a given sentence, it is important to consider the context and meaning of the words to ensure that the correct entity is predicted. In this example, "stylize" is the correct answer as it is a word that is derivationally

From these examples, I understand that the _derivationally\_related\_form of a word can be related to the action or process the word describes. In the first example, the word "incubate" describes a process of growing or developing something in a controlled environment, the _derivationally\_related\_form of which is "incubator".

The second example reinforces the pattern that I have observed earlier, where the task may involve predicting the tail entity of a "derivationally\_related\_form" relationship

Understood. The examples show that the tail entity can be the same as the given entity or a derivationally related form of it. I will use this pattern to predict the tail entities for my given goal question and candidate answers.

For instance, if my goal question is "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (trail, _derivationally\_related\_form\_of, [MASK]) by completing the sentence 'what is the _derivationally

******
Understood, I will keep this pattern in mind. The derived form of the original word is often a verb related to the noun or an instrument related to the verb. For example, the noun "incubate" has a derived verb "incubate" which shares the same meaning. Similarly, the verb "stabilize" is derived from the noun "stabilization". This analogy can help me predict the missing word in the prompt question based on the relationship between

Understood, I will remember this information. The "derivationally\_related\_form of" relationship generally refers to a word that is related in meaning to the original word, often through some kind of morphological transformation, whereas the "also\_see of" relationship generally refers to a word or concept that is related to the original word through a semantic or associative connection. With this information, I will analyze the given examples and apply the appropriate relationship to the goal question.

The examples suggest that the hypernym of a term can be more general or abstract in nature. The hypernym of "puerility" is "immaturity" and the hypernym of "part to whole relation" is "semantic relation". Both the hypernyms are broader, more general concept that encompass the original term.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I can assist you with link prediction and sorting by ordering the candidate answers to a given goal question based on their likelihood of being the correct answer.
******
The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (breaking, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of breaking? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question.

From the given examples, the pattern seems to be predicting the hypernym or more general category of a given entity to complete the given sentence. In the first example, the hypernym of "make" is "modify", and in the second example, the hypernym of "physical object" is "physical entity". Therefore, I should use my knowledge of hypernyms and complete the sentence "what is the hypernym of breaking?" with the answer that is the most likely hyper

******
From the given examples, I not only understand the pattern of completing the sentence with a hypernym, but also should take note of the additional information about derivationally related forms. The hypernym of "splintering" is "breaking", and the derivationally related form of "breaking" is "split up". Therefore, I should use my knowledge of hypernyms, derivationally related forms, and also the given decision of filling "breaking" and "split up" in the

******
Additionally, the examples also illustrate a more specific scenario where the hypernym is a type of transparent object, or a part of a larger entity. Therefore, I will keep those factors in mind and complete the sentence "what is the hypernym of breaking?" with the answer that is the most specific and most likely hypernym that fits within that context.

******
Yes, the supplementary information about derivationally related forms is helpful and should be taken into account when completing the sentence "what is the hypernym of breaking?". But since I am asked to order the candidate answer based on their likelihood, I will consider break is the most likely to be the hypernym of breaking and the other candidates in next likelihood based on my knowledge and the given examples.

The answer is ". The answer is youth subculture, so the [MASK] is youth subculture. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Yes, and considering the examples of "genus caretta" and "reptile genus", the hierarchy of hypernym should be considered too when ordering the candidates. Similarly, in the case of breaking the most general term I can think of is "action" but since actions are not commonly categorized as hypernyms or types of breaking, it is less likely than "event" or "process"
So I will take my knowledge and the given examples to order the candidates by likelihood.

******
Yes, the given examples of "derivationally\_related\_form" also remind that words can be related to each other in various ways and in this specific context, I have to consider the relationship is derivational. Based on that and my knowledge, I will order the candidates of the given goal question by likelihood.

The answer is ". The answer is exchange, so the [MASK] is exchange. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
The examples provided demonstrate that hypernyms can be the more general concept of the given word. In the first example, "piece" is a type of "portion", and in the second example, "break" is used as a type of "exchange" which seems a bit off and may be a mistake.
But in general it is true that sometimes actions like breaking are related with processes of exchange, for example breaking a record, or breaking a habit (replace an old bad habit

The answer is ". The answer is breaking, so the [MASK] is breaking. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
I will keep in mind that rupture is a type of breaking or hypernym of breaking when I order the candidates based on the given goal question.

As well as, I will keep in mind that break and breaking are related to each other through derivational form, and it would be a valid candidate to fill the [MASK], when I order the candidates based on the given goal question.

The answer is ". The answer is implementation, so the [MASK] is implementation. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
From these examples, I understand that when a hypernym of a given word is needed, the answer should be a more general concept. With the first example, jelly fungus is more general concept of jew's-ears as it is one type of jew's-ears, and the second example, implementation is more general concept of motorization as it one of the result of motorization.
I will keep in mind this point too when I order the candidates.

******
Based on the given examples, I understand that hypernym of a given word is more general concept and in the examples it was given as breaking for smashing, also I should pay attention to the derivationally related forms which was also given as snap off for breaking.
I will consider all these nuances to sort the candidate answers in priority order based on the given goal question.

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (hydrogen carbonate, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of hydrogen carbonate?

The answer is ". The answer is unconsciousness, so the [MASK] is unconsciousness. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
The given examples illustrate that the "hypernym of" relationship refers to a more general term than the given entity. For instance, the hypernym of "hydrogen carbonate" is "carbonate" as carbonate is a broader term than hydrogen carbonate.
Additionally, the following examples remind me that hypernyms can be in different granularities, for instance "comatoseness" is a state of being "unconsciousness", which may also include

Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (fracture, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of fracture? The answer is ".

The answer is ". The answer is breaking, so the [MASK] is breaking. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
I understand that in the first example, "breaking" is a hypernym for "fracture" and that in the second example, "breaking" is a derivationally related form of "split up". This means that for the first example, "breaking" is a broader concept that encompasses "fracture", while in the second example, the word "splitting" can be substituted for "split up" with a similar meaning.

I will keep these insights

******
The first analogy indicates that the given word 'breaking' should be ordered as the first candidate in the sorting task, because it's the hypernym of 'fracture' and 'rupture', which are the positive samples based on the analogy.
The second analogy suggests that the semantic relation is the hypernym of the given relation, so it's not directly related to the sorting task, but it might be useful to consider when determining the relationships among the

******
The given examples show that the "derivationally\_related\_form" relationship can be used to identify words that are related in terms of their formation, such as break and breaking. This information should be helpful in understanding the different relationships between words in the task of sorting the candidates.

The previous examples, with the puerility and immaturity, leads me to the thought that in this specific task, the words should be sorted in terms of how specific or general they are

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (neomycin, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of neomycin? The answer is ".

The answer is ". The answer is performance, so the [MASK] is performance. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
The given examples demonstrate that the hypernym of a specific term can be a more general concept. For example, "neomycin" is a type of "antibiotic drug", and "trick" is a type of "performance". These examples should be taken into account when sorting the candidates by prioritizing the more general concepts over the specific terms.

Additionally, derivationally\_related\_form is another relationship between words, which should also be considered.

******
This example shows that the "hypernym of" relationship refers to a more general category of the given entity. In the second example, given "fisherman's lure" the hypernym of it is "lure".

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I can assist you with link prediction and sorting by ordering the candidate answers to a given goal question based on their likelihood of being the correct answer.
******
The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (take, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _also_see of take? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Yes, I understand. I will carefully read and analyze the given examples to summarize the way of thinking and mine potential relationships that will be helpful for sorting the candidate answers. I will remain silent until you prompt me to continue with the examples.

******
I understand the analogy examples provided. From the examples, we can infer that the "also_see of" relation suggests a semantic connection between the two entities, and the candidate answer that completes the "[MASK]" should be semantically related to the given entity. Based on the provided answers, we can derive a rule such as: "the candidate answer should have an 'also_see' relationship with the given entity, and should reflect an attribute or characteristic of the given entity

******
From the supplementary information examples, I understand that the relations provided in the goal question (e.g., `_synset_domain_topic_of`, `_hypernym`) are crucial in determining the correct candidate answer. For the first example, the answer can be obtained by following the `_synset_domain_topic_of` relation, which suggests that the missing entity should be semantically related to the concept of mercantilism, as found in the answer.

******
I understand the pattern from these additional analogy examples. They suggest that the candidate answer should be semantically related to the provided answer for the "[MASK]" in the sentence "what is the \_also\_see of [entity]?", following the same 'also\_see' relationship. This reinforces the inference that we are looking for candidates with an 'also\_see' relationship with the given entity, and the candidates should be semantically related as indicated by the

The answer is ". The answer is new, so the [MASK] is new. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
These analogy examples strengthen the idea that the relationship between the primary entity and the candidate is one of associative or descriptive relatedness, rather than purely hierarchical or topical. This implies that, for the given goal question, the candidate answer for "[MASK]" should be closely related semantically to "take" through an "also\_see" relationship. It also suggests that the provided answer for "take" would be an appropriate candidate for the "[MASK]" position

The answer is replace, so the [MASK] is replace. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
I understand that these examples demonstrate that the "also\_see" relationship can imply a semantic range related to the primary entity, which can include actions or attributes. For the given question, the candidate answer for the "[MASK]" position should be conceptually relevant to "take" based on the "also\_see" relationship, even if its relationship to "take" isn't explicitly hierarchical or topical. The primary entity can have a broader meaning, and therefore the candidate answer

The answer is warmhearted, so the [MASK] is warmhearted. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
These examples further indicate that the "also\_see" relationship may be less constrained in terms of topic or hierarchy and can include a broader range of semantic associations, such as synonyms, antonyms, or other related concepts. This strengthens the idea that the candidate answer for the "[MASK]" position should be broadly relevant to "take" based on the "also\_see" relationship, encompassing a broader range of conceptual relationships.

******
From these examples, I can see a pattern where the "also\_see" relationship often has a semantic association of either a synonym, similar meaning, or a specific use case of the primary entity. The candidate answer for the "[MASK]" position should be closely related to "take" based on the "also\_see" relationship.

Continuing the analysis, it is observed that the "also\_see" relationship establishes a semantic relationship that reflects different aspects, properties, or related terms corresponding to the given primary entity.

In this context, the candidate answer for the "[MASK]" in "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (take, \_also\_see of, [MASK])" should be also\_see related to "take". It may represent a synonym, anton

Based on the provided examples, the "also\_see" relationship seems to connect the primary entity with related concepts, properties, or synonyms. This relationship can also include antonyms or specific exemplifications.

For the current task, the candidate answer for the "[MASK]" in "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (take, \_also\_see of, [MASK])" should possess an "also\_see" relationship with the primary entity "

With the analysis of the provided examples, the "also\_see" relationship represents connections between the primary entity and related concepts, properties, or synonyms, as well as antonyms or specific examples.

For the current task, the candidate answer for the "[MASK]" in "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (take, \_also\_see of, [MASK])" should have a strong "also\_see" relationship with the primary entity "
