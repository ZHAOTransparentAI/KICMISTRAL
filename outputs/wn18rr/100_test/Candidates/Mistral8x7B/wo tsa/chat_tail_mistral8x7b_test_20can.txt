The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (trade name, _member_of_domain_usage of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _member_of_domain_usage of trade name? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (telephone, _verb_group of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _verb_group of telephone? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Based on the examples provided, I can see a pattern where the [MASK] entity in each example is the same as the answer to the question "what is the _verb_group of [given phrase]?" This suggests that for the goal question, I should sort the candidate answers according to their relevance as a verb group for the given phrase "telephone." Additionally, the examples show a variety of verb forms such as "take," "develop," "switch," and "give

From the additional examples provided, I can see that I should also take into account the outlined relations in order to sort the candidate answers. This means that I should prioritize candidates that have a _synset\_domain\_topic\_of_ relation with "telephone" as "telephony", and candidates that are _derivationally\_related\_form_ to "telephone" as "telephone set".

The supplementary examples provide additional context for the task. The first two examples suggest that in some cases, the tail entity is the same as the provided entity (drill), which might indicate that the relationship could be reflexive. The third example further confirms that the relationship to be determined involves the "has part of" relationship, which is consistent with the goal question. Lastly, the fourth example expands the possibilities by introducing the "hypernym of" relationship, which could potentially

Based on these analogical examples, I have identified several patterns in the context and the relationships between the entities that will be helpful in completing the given goal question.

One pattern I have identified is that the second entity in the tuple is often the most specific category of the first entity, which can be identified by the hypernym relationship between them. This means that the missing entity [MASK] will be a more general category that encompasses the given entity "surface".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (sophisticated, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _also_see of sophisticated? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

These further examples reinforce the idea that the hypernym of an entity can refer to a more abstract concept or a broader category, as in the case of "expensiveness" and "price". They also show that the hypernym can sometimes refer to a relationship, such as "freeze" and "put under", or to a particular group or class of objects, as in the case of "saxe-coburg-gotha" and "royalty", or "

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (time to come, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of time to come? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

From the given examples, the task requires analogy and the completion of a sentence with a _hypernym of relation. From the first example, we see the pattern of predicting a hypernym for the word "make" which is "modify." From the second example, we learn that the hypernym of physical object is physical entity. From the third and fourth example, we see that the hypernyms can be a multi-word and a more specific term such as "transparent gem

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers in order of relevance to the goal question.
******
The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (systems software, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of systems software? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

******
From the given examples, I can summarize the following way of thinking:

1. In all the examples, the second [MASK] is filled with a hypernym (a word or phrase that denotes a class of things to which the given thing belongs) of the first entity in the triple.
2. To predict the answer for the goal question, I need to find a hypernym of "systems software."
3. To help with this, I note that the relation "

******
Continuing to analyze these additional examples, I can observe:

1. In these examples, the second [MASK] represents a broader category for the first entity.
2. For "genus caretta," it was replaced with a more general term "reptile genus," highlighting its connection as a specific type of reptile.
3. For "hipsters," it was replaced with "youth subculture," pointing out its classification as a subcategory within "

******
After more analysis of these examples, I notice:

1. In each instance, the second [MASK] represents a higher level of categorization for the first entity.
2. In some cases, the hypernym connects to the broader category, such as "jelly fungus" as a hypernym for "jew's-ears."
3. In other instances, the hypernym represents the overall concept, like "implementation" for "motorization"

******
Continuing to analyze these further examples, I observe:

1. The second [MASK] consistently represents an abstract or more general concept encompassing the initial entity.
2. In the first example, "immaturity" serves as a broader concept for "puerility."
3. In the second example, the hypernym "semantic relation" is used to better categorize the specific relationship presented as "part to whole relation."

All these examples will help in

The answer is ". The answer is railway locomotive, so the [MASK] is railway locomotive. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Analyzing these examples helps deepen the understanding of how to assign a hypernym to the initial entity:

1. In some instances, the hypernym might be another level of categorization, as seen with "railway locomotive" for "diesel locomotive."
2. As with the examples of "picture show" and "lure," the hypernym could also represent a broader category under which the initial entity is classified.
3. Continuing

The answer is ". The answer is set, so the [MASK] is set. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Continuing the analysis, I discern the following about these examples:

1. The hypernym of an initial entity may represent a higher level of categorization, as in the case of "hire" for "subcontract."
2. The pattern is consistent with previously observed examples, such as "unhappiness" for "sorrow" and "islamic calendar month" for "muharrum."
3. As seen before, the hypernym can also represent

The answer is ". The answer is spiritualty, so the [MASK] is spiritualty. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Observing these new examples, I can infer:

1. The connection between the two entities could involve categorizing the initial entity into a broader or more generic concept.
2. For example, "structure" is the hypernym for "tower" at a higher level of categorization, while "spiritualty" includes "ecclesiastical benefice" as a narrower category.
3. In some instances, the hypernym might not directly reflect a clear

The answer is ". The answer is play, so the [MASK] is play. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Following these examples, I can understand:

1. The second entity in the given example represents a higher level of categorization than the first entity, which could be a direct hypernym or an abstract concept.
2. An example is "change" as a hypernym for "modernize" or "literary criticism" as a hypernym for "textual criticism."
3. This analysis will help determine the [MASK] in the main goal question.

The answer is ". The answer is people, so the [MASK] is people. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
I will continue to analyze these examples by:

1. Recognizing that the hypernym may involve a broader category, a higher level of abstraction, or an action associated with the initial term as in the case of "put under" for "freeze" and "price" for "expensiveness."
2. Applying the patterns found in these examples to the main goal question.

I will keep in mind the following insights when analyzing these examples:

1. A hypernym can represent a broader category, a higher level of abstraction, or actions related to the initial term.
	* For instance, "give" for "corn" and "screen" for "windshield."
2. Higher-level abstract concepts can also be considered hypernyms, as seen with "arthropod genus" for "genus cancer"

Understood. From the examples, I can see a pattern where the tail entity to be predicted is a word that is derivationally related to the given entity. This relationship can be observed in the examples, as the provided answers are all derivationally related to the given entities (set up - effect, misunderstanding - misunderstand, hold - concurrency, parcel - parcelling).

Based on the examples, it appears that the relationship between the given entity and candidate answer could be:

1. The candidate answer is a form (noun, verb, or adjective) that is derivationally related to the given entity, like in the case of "think" and "thought", or "register" and "register".
2. The candidate answer shares a similar concept or meaning with the given entity, but it has a different derivational form, like

Based on the examples provided, when the given entity and the tail entity have a derivationally related form, the tail entity may not always directly relate to the given entity's definition, but rather be a component or related concept.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (tragelaphus scriptus, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of tragelaphus scriptus? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.

Understood, I will keep these examples in mind and think carefully about the way of thinking used in each one. Based on the given examples, it seems that the task is to predict the hypernym of a given entity by completing a given sentence. The hypernym is a higher-level category or concept that the given entity falls under. For instance, in the first example, "make" is a type of "modify", and in the second example, "physical object" is a

******
I will keep this additional example in mind as well, and note that the relationship in this example is not "hypernym" but rather "member-meronym". In this case, the missing term is a specific member or part of the larger category, in this case "tragelaphus scriptus" is a member of "tragelaphus".

I will also keep in mind these additional examples and the relationships they demonstrate. Based on these examples, hypernyms are broader categories that a given entity falls under. We can see that genus caretta is a type of reptile genus, hipsters are a type of youth subculture, piece is a type of portion, and break is a type of exchange. I will remember this pattern and apply it to the sorting task at hand.

I will keep in mind these additional examples as well. Based on these examples, I can see that in some cases, the hypernym may be a narrower category than the given entity, such as with "hydrogen carbonate" and "carbonate", or "comatoseness" and "unconsciousness". I will remember this pattern and apply it to the sorting task when giving the output.

I will carefully consider these additional examples as well. Based on these examples, it appears that the hypernym relationship can be quite broad and can apply to concepts and categories at various levels of abstraction. I will use this understanding to guide my approach to the sorting task at hand. Thus, I summarize that hypernym can be a quite broad relationship between entities, and this information will help me to understand the goal question and example which I can apply to sort the candidate answer list.

I will keep these additional examples in mind, which show that the given entities can also be a specific feeling or mood, a month in a specific calendar, or a verb with a certain meaning.

I will consider these additional examples, which demonstrate that hypernyms can also be used to refer to professions or roles, such as a physician in the case of abortionist, or to concepts like spirituality in the case of ecclesiastical benefice. I understand that all these examples show the relationship between entities in a sentence which serve as a clue in realizing the hypernymy relationships between them. With this knowledge, I am well prepared to sort the candidate answers for the goal question

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (dita bark, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of dita bark? The answer is ". The answer is tree, so the [MASK] is tree. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (modernize, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of modernize?

I will also consider these additional examples, which help to further demonstrate the broad range of potential hypernyms. For instance, in the case of "dita bark," the hypernym is simply "tree," while in the case of "modernize," the hypernym is a more abstract concept, "change." Similarly, "textual criticism" is a type of "literary criticism" and "walk" is a type of "play". These examples will help me in sorting the

I understand, those are useful examples. I'll remember that "freeze" falls under the hypernym "put under", "expensiveness" falls under "price", "saxe-coburg-gotha" falls under "royalty", and "nationality" falls under "people". These examples help to solidify my understanding of hypernyms, and will help me during the sorting task.

I understand, those are examples I'll keep in mind while I am performing the sorting task.

I understand that some examples contain supplementary information about the concepts of "derivationally related form" and "hypernym." Based on this information, it seems that the entities "praise," "compliment," and "eulogy" are all related to each other, and "praise" is a hypernym of both "compliment" and "eulogy." This reinforces the idea that the tail entity I need to predict will be related to the provided

I understand the pattern in these examples: the tail entity is the derivationally related form of the provided entity. In some cases, the derivationally related form may be a more formal or technical term than the provided entity (e.g., "record" and "registrar"), while in other cases it may be a less common synonym or alternate form (e.g., "nickname" and "soubriquet").

From these additional examples, I can see that the hypernym of "pean" is "praise," which reinforces the earlier examples I studied that showed the relationship between "compliment" and "praise," and "eulogy" and "praise." It seems that "praise" can be a hypernym for a variety of related concepts.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (ulmus carpinifolia, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of ulmus carpinifolia? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Understood, I will keep thinking about these additional examples but will not output yet. Based on the new example, I can see that the relationship between the entities is different from the previous examples, as it is "_member\_meronym of" instead of "_hypernym of". However, this new example provides me with additional context about the entity "ulmus", which can be helpful in understanding and sorting the candidate answers for the original question.

Other times, the derivationally\_related\_form may be a word with a slightly different spelling and meaning, as in the example of "think" and "thought

The answer is ". The answer is physical contact, so the [MASK] is physical contact. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
From these additional examples, I can see that sometimes the derivationally\_related\_form of a word can be the same as the word itself, as in the examples of "think", "stop", and "cook". This suggests that I should be careful not to always expect the derivationally\_related\_form to be a completely different word. Additionally, the example of "touch" and "physical contact" shows that the relationship between a word and its derivationally\_related\_

******
From these examples, I can see that the relationship between a word and its derivationally\_related\_form can be quite complex. In some cases, the derivationally\_related\_form is a word that is formed by removing a prefix or suffix from the original word, as in the examples of "hold on" and "hold" or "mindfulness" and "mindful". In other cases, the derivationally\_related\_form is a word that describes the process or means

******
From these examples, I can see that sometimes the derivationally\_related\_form of a word is a word with a similar meaning or performing a similar function. In the example of "structure" and "structure", the word is repeated, meaning that there is no derivationally\_related\_form, but instead the word being used as both noun and verb. The second example shows that a word can be derivationally\_related\_form of another by having a common root, as

From these examples, I can see that the derivationally\_related\_form of a word can represent a concept closely associated with the word, such as the result of or the state of performing the action described by the word.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (andante, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of andante? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting.

Based on the examples provided, I will use analogy and memorize the relationships between the entities to predict the hypernym of "andante". From the examples, I see that the hypernym of "make" is "modify" and the hypernym of "physical object" is "physical entity". This suggests that hypernyms are more general categories that encompass the given entities.

Based on the supplementary information provided, I will also consider the specific definition and context of "andante" to determine its hypernym. From the examples, I have already understood that the hypernym is a more general category that encompasses the given entity. And now, I have the specific answer that the hypernym of "andante" is "passage". I will use this information to guide my sorting of the candidate answers.

The answer is ". The answer is spiritualty, so the [MASK] is spiritualty. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
These examples show that predicting the hypernym of a word involves finding a broader category to which it belongs. Here, "abortionist" is a type of "physician", "suspect" is a type of "venture", "tower" is a type of "structure", and "ecclesiastical benefice" is a type of "spiritualty". The hypernym is a general term that encompasses the given word and other related terms.

The answer is ". The answer is play, so the [MASK] is play. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
These examples show that hypernyms refer to more general categories of words. For instance, "dita bark" is a kind of "tree", "modernize" is a kind of "change", "textual criticism" is a kind of "literary criticism", and "walk" is a kind of "play". By understanding the hierarchical relationships between different words, we can help order candidate answers in a more informed and coherent way.

Understood, I will not output yet. Based on the given examples, I can see a pattern where the goal is to predict the tail entity of the given entity based on the "_synset\_domain\_topic\_of" relation. The examples suggest that the tail entity is a specific domain that the given entity belongs to or is associated with.

To summarize the way of thinking:

* Identify the given entity in the prompt.
* Determine the domain or topic
******
Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (hit, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of hit? The answer is ".

The answer is ". The answer is per se, so the [MASK] is per se. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the given supplementary information, I notice that the word "hit" can be a noun or a verb and it is related to the concept of "tally" and "per se," which may be relevant when predicting the tail entity for the prompt related to "hit" and "synset\_domain\_topic\_of." However, I will not make any conclusions until I have reviewed all the examples and have been instructed to output my answer.

******
From the given examples, I can see that the tail entity for the "_synset\_domain\_topic\_of" relation can be a more specific subfield when the given entity is a more general topic. For example, the tail entity of "algebra" is "maths." I will keep this in mind when sorting the candidate answers for the goal question.

From the given supplementary information, I notice that "hit" is a derivationally related form of itself and a hypernym of "safety," neither of which seem relevant to the goal question about the "_synset\_domain\_topic\_of" relation.

******
Based on the additional examples, it appears that the "_synset\_domain\_topic\_of" relation can also involve a more specific topic as the tail entity for a given entity that is a more general topic. For instance, the tail entity for "game" is "tennis," which is a specific type of game. I will keep this in mind when sorting the candidate answers for the goal question.

The examples for freeze and put under shows that- a freeze can be viewed as an action that put something under, expensiveness can be a attribute of price, saxe-coburg-gotha is a subset, and nationality is

From the above examples, I understand that predicting the hypernym of an entity can involve determining a category, action, or attribute related to the entity. For instance, the hypernym of "corn" could be considered as "give" as it can refer to the act of giving something. Similarly, for "genus cancer", the hypernym "arthropod genus" is an umbrella category for the entity, and for "shenanigan", the hypernym is

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers in order of relevance to the goal question.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (wive, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of wive? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Yes, I understand. I will carefully read and analyze the examples, trying to understand the potential meaning of the goal question and identifying any relationships or useful information that may help with sorting the candidate answers. I will remain silent while you provide the examples.

Based on the given examples, I will look for the hypernym of "wife" to complete the sentence "what is the hypernym of wife?" I will use analogy and identify any patterns in the examples to sort the candidate answers. I will remember that all the examples have a single-word answer.

In the first example, the hypernym of "make" is "modify". Analogous to this, I will look for a hypernym that is more general than

I will also consider these additional examples provided to help with my sorting task. In these examples, I will note that the answers are single-word answers and that a hypernym can be a more specific category as well, for example, in the first example, a reptile genus. I will look for a hypernym for "wife" that is a more specific category if necessary, and use these additional examples to help guide my sorting.

******
I'll also consider these new examples to further guide my sorting. I now notice that some answers are still single words but some could also be multiple words long phrases. The categorization can be broader or more specific. I will still look for a hypernym of "wife", even if it's a more specific category. These new examples won't affect the goal question's expected answer.

With these additional examples, I observe that categorization can be at different levels of specificity and that some answers are multiple-word phrases. These examples also demonstrate a wide variety of categories. However, they don't change the context of the original task regarding the hypernym of "wife". I'll keep them in mind to help me identify any patterns that might support sorting the candidate answers.

I've analyzed the new examples, and I see that the answers are generally at a lower level of specificity, consist of multiple words, and cover various domains. I will remember this information when sorting the candidate answers for the actual question, but the examples provided do not affect the expected answer for the hypernym of "wife". I will continue considering the different levels of specificity and length of the answers as I sort the candidates.

I've taken note of these new examples and considered the different aspects of the answers like specificity, length, and domains. These insights might be helpful when sorting the candidates for the actual question. However, none of these examples change the core task related to finding the hypernym of "wife". I'll make sure to account for these observations when sorting the candidates while being mindful of the varying levels of specificity and length in the answers.

I'll keep these additional examples in mind when sorting the candidates. The answers I see include multiple words and cover different domains, but none of them change the task of finding the hypernym of "wife".

I will utilize these extra examples for the sorting task, focusing on the variations in specificity, length, and domains.

To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

From the given examples, I can summarize the way of thinking as follows: we need to predict the hypernym of the given concept by completing the sentence "what is the hypernym of [concept]?". In each example, the concept is a specific entity, and the hypernym is a higher-level category that the concept belongs to. The goal is to predict the correct hypernym that fits the concept.

From the given examples, the relationships between the concepts and hyperny

Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (warping, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of warping? The answer is ". The answer is warp, so the [MASK] is warp. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (warp, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of warp? The answer is ". The answer is warping, so the [MASK] is warping. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the supplementary information, we can see that there is a relationship of derivational relatedness between the concept and the answer. This relationship indicates that the answer is a form that is derived from the concept. For example, the concept "warping" is related to "warp" because "warping" is a gerund form of the verb "warp".

With this information, we can expand our thinking to include possible derivational related forms when sorting the candidate answers

Based on the new examples, we can see that the hypernym of a concept can be a more general category that encompasses the concept. For instance, in the first example, the hypernym of "genus caretta" is "reptile genus", which is a more general category than "genus caretta". Similarly, in the second example, "hipsters" is a specific type of "youth subculture".

From the given examples, I can see that the [MASK] in the sentence completion task refers to the hypernym of the given entity. A hypernym is a term that has a broader meaning and includes the given entity. For example, for the entity "Erin", the hypernym "Ireland" is the correct answer because Ireland is a broader term that includes Erin as a part of it.

To sort the candidate answers for the goal question, I will need to determine

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers in order of relevance to the goal question.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (vomiting, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of vomiting? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (make, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of make? The answer is ". The answer is modify, so the [MASK] is modify. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (physical object, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of physical object? The answer is ". The answer is physical entity, so the [MASK] is physical entity. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (garnet, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of garnet? The answer is ". The answer is transparent gem, so the [MASK] is transparent gem. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (caudate nucleus, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of caudate nucleus? The answer is ". The answer is basal ganglion, so the [MASK] is basal ganglion. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the examples, I will use the hypernymy relationship to sort the candidate answers. To predict the hypernym of vomiting, I will look for a candidate answer that represents a higher level of abstraction in the taxonomy. From the examples, I can see that "modify" is a hypernym of "make", "physical entity" is a hypernym of "physical object", "transparent gem" is a hypernym of "garnet", and

Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (vomit up, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of vomit up? The answer is ". The answer is vomiting, so the [MASK] is vomiting. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (rumination, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of rumination? The answer is ". The answer is vomiting, so the [MASK] is vomiting. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (vomiting, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of vomiting?

The answer is unconditioned reflex, so the [MASK] is unconditioned reflex. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (vomiting, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of vomiting? The answer is ". The answer is vomit up, so the [MASK] is vomit up. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the supplementary information from the examples, I will also consider the relationship of derivationally related form when sorting the candidate answers. From the examples, I can see that "vomiting" is a derivationally related form of "vomit up" and a hypernym of "rumination". Therefore, I will prioritize candidates that have a hypernymy or derivationally related form relationship with "vomiting", while also considering the taxonomy and the level

The answer is ". The answer is exchange, so the [MASK] is exchange. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the new examples, I will expand my reasoning to not only consider hypernymy, but also hypernymy with respect to the specific category. From the examples, I can see that the answer for "genus caretta" is a more specific type of hypernym than just "reptile". Similarly, I can see that the answer for "hipsters" is a more specific type of hypernym than "youth subculture". For "piece", the answer "port

******
Based on the supplementary information from the examples, I will consider the relationship of hypernymy when sorting the candidate answers, specifically with the goal of identifying candidates that have a hypernymy relationship with "vomiting". I will also prioritize candidates that represent higher levels of abstraction in the taxonomy, taking into account the specific category and the relationships between the candidates.

I will also consider the level of abstraction and the specific category when considering the relationship of hypernymy. In the given examples, "jelly fungus" is a more specific type of hypernym than "jew's-ears" and "unconsciousness" is a more specific type of hypernym than "comatoseness". I will use this understanding to sort the candidate answers based on their relationship to "vomiting" and the level of abstraction

Based on the previous examples, I will also take into account the relationships between the candidates when considering the relationship of hypernymy, especially if the candidates have a more specific type of hypernymy or if they belong to a certain category. For instance, in the case of "immaturity" and "puerility", "immaturity" is the more specific type of hypernym. Similarly, I will sort the candidate answers based on their relationship to "vomiting", their level

Based on the previous examples, I will consider the relationships between the candidates for the relationship of hypernymy and their level of abstraction. For instance, in the case of "collage film" and "picture show", "picture show" is the more general type of hypernym. Similarly, I will sort the candidate answers based on their relationship to "vomiting" and their level of abstraction, taking into account any additional relationships between the candidates.

Based on the previous examples, I will take into account the specific relationships and abstraction levels of the candidates when predicting the hypernym of "vomiting". I will prioritize candidates that reflect a high level of abstraction and have a semantic relationship to the given candidate. I will continue to refrain from output until given permission.

Based on the previous examples, I understand that the relationship of hypernymy is not always a simple one-to-one mapping and may require consideration of context and abstraction level. In the case of predicting the hypernym of "vomiting", I will consider various levels of abstraction and contexts to sort the candidate answers. I will continue to refrain from output until explicitly instructed.

Based on the examples, the approach for sorting candidate answers for the goal question would involve considering the relationships and contexts of the candidates to determine the appropriate level of abstraction. For instance, when given the candidate answers for "vomiting", I would need to analyze and compare their semantic relationships to determine which candidates represent the appropriate level of abstraction for the hypernym. I will remain silent until explicitly instructed to output my sorted answer.
