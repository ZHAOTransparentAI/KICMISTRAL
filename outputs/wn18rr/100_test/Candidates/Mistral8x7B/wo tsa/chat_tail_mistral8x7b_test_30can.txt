The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (trade name, _member_of_domain_usage of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _member_of_domain_usage of trade name? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (telephone, _verb_group of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _verb_group of telephone? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

From the additional examples provided, I can see that I should also take into account the outlined relations in order to sort the candidate answers. This means that I should prioritize candidates that have a _synset\_domain\_topic\_of_ relation with "telephone" as "telephony", and candidates that are _derivationally\_related\_form_ to "telephone" as "telephone set".

I can observe that the derivationally related form of the initial word can be an abstract concept related to the initial word. For example, the derivationally related form of "think" is "thought", the derivationally related form of "stimulate" is "vitality", and the derivationally related form of "cooperation" is "join forces". In the case of "theory of relativity", the derivationally related form is an adjective

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (sophisticated, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _also_see of sophisticated? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

From the given examples, I can see a pattern of predicting the hypernym entity for a given entity. The hypernym entity is a more general category that the given entity belongs to. In the first example, the entity "erin" is a more specific instance of the hypernym entity "ireland". Similarly, in the second example, "marlene dietrich" is a specific instance of the hypernym entity "vocalizer".

To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers in order of relevance to the goal question.
******
The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (major premiss, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of major premiss? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.
******
Yes, I understand. I will carefully read and analyze the examples, looking for patterns and relationships that may help me sort the candidate answers for the goal question. I will remain silent while you provide the examples.

******
Based on the given examples, I will look for the hypernym of the major premiss for each candidate answer, and sort them in ascending order based on the length of the shortest path to the target hypernym. In this case, the target hypernym is the answer to the given [MASK] entity in each example. By using this method, I will prioritize candidate answers that have a shorter path to the target hypernym. Additionally, I will consider any supplementary information provided to
******
Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (major premiss, _has_part of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _has_part of major premiss? The answer is ". The answer is middle term, so the [MASK] is middle term. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (syllogism, _has_part of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _has_part of syllogism? The answer is ". The answer is major premiss, so the [MASK] is major premiss. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the additional supplementary information, I will also consider the relationship of "has\_part" in addition to the "hypernym" relationship while sorting the candidate answers. I will prioritize the candidate answers that not only have a shorter path to the target hypernym but also have a direct "has\_part" relationship with the major premiss or the target hypernym. By taking into account both relationships, I can sort the candidate answers with greater accuracy and relevance to the goal question

******
Based on the additional examples, I will continue to prioritize the hypernym relationship while sorting the candidate answers. However, I will also consider the possible variations in the target hypernym as shown in the new examples. For instance, the target hypernym for "genus caretta" is "reptile genus" while for "hipsters" it is "youth subculture". This indicates that the target hypernym may not always be a single word, but a phrase that describes

The additional examples further illustrate the variations in the target hypernym, which can be single or multi-word phrases. I will continue to take this into account while sorting the candidate answers. Additionally, I will also consider any potential word sense variations in the major premiss and the given hyponym, as shown in the example "motorization" which has the hypernym "implementation" and not "motor". The ability to accurately determine the correct sense of a word is crucial

The new examples further highlight the importance of considering the correct sense of a word and the variations in the target hypernym, which can be a single or multi-word phrase. For instance, the hypernym of "neomycin" is "antibiotic drug" and not simply "drug". Similarly, the hypernym of "trick" is "performance" and not a more specific type of act or deception.

The new examples suggest that the target hypernym may not always be the most specific or general category for the major premiss, but rather a suitable mid-level category. For instance, the hypernym of "collage film" is "picture show" and not simply "film" or "movie". Similarly, the hypernym of "diesel locomotive" is "railway locomotive" and not simply "locomotive" or "engine". By accurately determining

From the examples, I understand that the goal is to predict the tail entity of the given relationship by completing the sentence "what is the \_has\_part of [entity]?" The examples suggest that the tail entity describes a component, part, or stage related to the given entity. I will keep this thinking in mind while processing further information.

With the supplementary information, I now understand that the task can also involve finding hypernyms for the given entities. This suggests that the required relationships may involve more general concepts. In the second example, I see that a Mebibyte (MIB) has a part that is a Kilobyte (KB), which aligns with the overall theme of parts and components from the previous examples. I will continue to analyze any additional information given and adjust my understanding accordingly.

From these additional analogy examples, I see that the \_has\_part of relationship involves a whole and its components or parts. This reinforces the earlier understanding of the concept.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers in order of relevance to the goal question.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (roof, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of roof? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

I have analyzed the examples and summarized the way of thinking. In each example, the goal is to predict the hypernym of a given entity. The hypernym is a more general category that the given entity belongs to.

Here are the examples again for reference:

I have analyzed the supplementary information provided in the additional examples. The new information includes a derivationally related form example and an example involving a has\_part relationship.

The derivationally related form example suggests that the word "roof" is a derivationally related form of itself, indicating that there may not be a distinct hypernym for "roof."

The has\_part example indicates that an "edifice" has a "roof" as a part

I have analyzed the additional analogy examples. The new examples suggest that the hypernym of a given entity is a more general category that the given entity belongs to, and can be a genus or a broader class of objects or concepts.

Here are the new examples for reference:

The new supplementary information provided in these examples suggests that "roof" can be a hypernym for other entities such as "dome" and "sunshine-roof." Additionally, the third example indicates that "roof" is a derivationally related form of itself, which confirms the previous example's suggestion that "roof" can be both a hypernym and a more specific entity.

These additional analogy examples show that the hypernym of a given entity can refer to a broader category or concept that the given entity belongs to.

For instance, the hypernym of "jew's-ears" is "jelly fungus," and the hypernym of "motorization" is "implementation." These hypernyms represent broader categories that the given entities belong to.

The examples used for analogy suggest that the hypernym of a given entity can refer to a more general concept or category that the given entity belongs to. For instance, the hypernym of "puerility" is "immaturity," and the hypernym of "neomycin" is "antibiotic drug."

These examples indicate that the hypernym can be a more abstract or general concept than the given entity, and that identifying the correct hypernym requires an understanding of

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (systems software, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of systems software? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.

From the given examples, I can summarize the following way of thinking:

1. In all the examples, the second [MASK] is filled with a hypernym (a word or phrase that denotes a class of things to which the given thing belongs) of the first entity in the triple.
2. To predict the answer for the goal question, I need to find a hypernym of "systems software."

Adding these examples can help refine my understanding:

1. Hypernyms can be multi-word phrases, like "reptile genus" for "genus caretta" and "youth subculture" for "hipsters."
2. In some cases, the hypernym may indicate an abstract concept, like "exchange" for "break."

To predict the answer for the goal question, I'll find a hypernym of "systems

The additional examples have provided me with further information:

1. Hypernyms can cover different levels of specificity and can include multi-word phrases or even a single word.
2. The hypernym might follow a specific level of abstraction, like going from "jelly fungus" to "jew's-ears."

With this knowledge, I'll predict the hypernym of "systems software" for the goal question:

These additional examples highlight the different levels of abstraction and granularity in hypernyms:

1. Going from "puerility" to "immaturity" is a step up in the level of abstraction.
2. The examples also demonstrate the shift from a specific concept to a more generic one, such as "semantic relation" or "antibiotic drug."

Applying this understanding to the goal question, I'll predict the hyper

The new examples further emphasize shifting between specific and general concepts while maintaining the appropriate abstraction level:

1. For "collage film → picture show" and "fisherman's lure → lure" examples, the hypernym is a single-word or a simple term with high overlap in meaning, representing a higher level of abstraction.
2. However, for "yelling → yell," the hypernym is a single-word term with minimal

Considering the recent examples:

Continuing my thought process, thinking about the given examples:

1. "Freeze → put under" demonstrates moving from a specific action to a general way of doing something which may require an object and a concept.
2. "Expensiveness → price" follows the established pattern of moving from a particular aspect of a concept to its underlying root, covering various realizations.

1. "Corn → give" seems to be less relevant to the given context and insufficient to predict a proper hypernym. However, based on our previous analogy, I assume the intended answer should be more related to "plant" rather than "give."
2. "Genus cancer → arthropod genus" exemplifies moving from a specific type of genus to a general class encompassing several

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (podcast, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of podcast? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Yes, I understand. I will carefully read and analyze the examples you provide, looking for patterns and relationships that may help me sort the candidate answers in a more informed way. I will summarize the key takeaways from the examples in my memory and wait for your instruction to output the sorted list.

Based on the examples provided, I can see that the task is to predict the hypernym of the given entity by completing a sentence. The examples suggest that the hypernym of the given entity is a more general category or class that the entity belongs to.

To sort the candidate answers, I will consider which answer represents the most general category or class that the given entity "podcast" belongs to. Additionally, I will keep in mind any supplementary information or patterns that may emerge from the

Based on the additional examples, I can see that the hypernym of the given entity can also be a broader category or classification that encompasses the entity. The first example suggests that the hypernym of a specific reptile genus (genus caretta) is the broader category of reptile genus.

To sort the candidate answers for the goal question, I will consider which answer represents the most general category or classification that the given entity "podcast" belongs to, while also

Based on these additional examples, it seems that the hypernym of a given entity can be a more abstract concept or a broader category that encompasses the entity's meaning or function. For instance, the hypernym of "neomycin" is "antibiotic drug," which is a more general category that includes various types of antibiotics. Similarly, the hypernym of "part to whole relation" is "semantic relation," which is a more abstract concept that encompass

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (tinned goods, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of tinned goods? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (tragelaphus scriptus, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of tragelaphus scriptus? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Based on the examples, I understand that the task is to predict the hypernym of the given entity by completing the given sentence. The hypernym is a term that represents a category or class of objects, including the given entity. I will use this way of thinking and the pattern of the examples to sort the candidate answers in order of relevance to the goal question.

Additionally, I will keep in mind the following information from the examples:

Based on the new supplementary information, I understand that the task can also involve identifying the meronym, or a part of the given entity. In this case, the meronym of "tragelaphus" is "tragelaphus scriptus", which means that "tragelaphus scriptus" is a part of "tragelaphus". I will keep this information in mind while sorting the candidate answers for the goal question, as it may provide additional context for understanding the

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (order casuarinales, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of order casuarinales? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

From the supplementary information, I understand that I can use additional relationships, such as _also\_see and _hypernym, to further inform my prediction of the tail entity. For example, the fact that the _also\_see of trail is tag along suggests a potential relationship between trail and tag along. Similarly, the fact that the hypernym of tree is trail suggests that trail is a more general category that includes tree. I will keep these relationships in mind while sorting the candidate answers.

These supplementary examples further emphasize that _derivationally\_related\_form relationship can indicate the same word, while _also\_see relationship can suggest related concepts or actions.

From these examples, I observe that the same relationship can result in the same word as the tail entity.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (andante, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of andante? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (breaking, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of breaking? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.

Understood, I will keep thinking but not output. From the supplementary information, I see that the entities "splintering" and "breaking" have a hypernym relationship, with "breaking" being the more general concept. Additionally, "breaking" and "split up" have a derivationally\_related\_form relationship, as do "break" and "breaking". This suggests that the task may involve understanding the relationships between different forms of words and their more general or specific meanings

Understood, I will not output yet. Based on the given examples, I can see a pattern where the goal is to predict the tail entity of the given entity based on the "_synset\_domain\_topic\_of" relation. The examples suggest that the tail entity is a specific domain that the given entity belongs to or is associated with.

To summarize the way of thinking:

* Identify the given entity in the prompt.
* Determine the domain or topic

Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (hit, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of hit? The answer is ".

******
Based on the given supplementary information, I will also consider the derivationally\_related\_form relation and the hypernym relation to determine the domain or topic of the given entity. The examples suggest that the derivationally\_related\_form relation can be used to determine synonyms or related words for the given entity, and the hypernym relation can be used to determine a broader category or concept for the given entity. These relationships may provide additional context or constraints for sorting the candidate answers

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (multiply, _synset_domain_topic_of of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _synset_domain_topic_of of multiply?

******
Based on the additional examples, I can see that the domain or topic for the given entity can be more specific than the general category or concept. For instance, the domain or topic for the word "algebra" is "maths", which is a more specific domain compared to simply "math". This observation reinforces the idea that understanding the context and the domain or topic for the given entity is crucial in predicting the tail entity.

I will keep the additional examples in mind when considering the sorting criteria for candidate answers. The derivationally\_related\_form relation can be helpful in identifying related words or phrases, while the hypernym relation can be helpful in identifying broader categories or concepts. However, in the last example, the given answer is not a hypernym of "safety", which suggests that the relation provided in the example may not be accurate or relevant. This emphasizes the importance of considering multiple sources of information

Thank you for providing the supplementary information. I understand that the word "freight" has the derivationally related form "freightage," which refers to the charges or expenses for transporting goods by a common carrier. Similarly, a "merchantman" is a large, seagoing ship used for carrying cargo commercially. These examples suggest that deriving a new word with the suffix "-age" may imply a commercial or service-related concept related to the original word.

Thank you for the examples. I understand the pattern that in some cases, the hypernym of a given entity is a broader category or concept that the entity belongs to. For instance, the hypernym of "dita bark" is "tree," and the hypernym of "modernize" is "change." Meanwhile, it seems that sometimes, the hypernym is more specific or closely related to the given entity, such as the hypernym of "textual criticism" being "literary

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (plus, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of plus? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

Based on the supplementary information, it seems that "plus" is often the hypernym of various entities. "Plus" is a term that implies addition or enhancement, so it makes sense that it would be a broad category for various entities.

It's worth noting that the first set of examples involved more specific terms such as "make" and "garnet," while the second set of examples involved more abstract terms such as "strong suit" and "resource." Despite the difference

The examples provided further suggest that the [MASK] in the goal question is an instance hypernym representing a more specific type or role that the given entity belongs to.

In the case of Yeats, wise men, and caucasus, they all represent specific individuals, groups, or places and are classified as

From these new examples, I can see that the task is asking for more abstract and generalized instance hypernyms for the given entities. The examples provided further suggest that the [MASK] in the goal question is an instance hypernym representing a more specific type or role that the given entity belongs to, but this time more abstract and generalized than previous examples.

In this case, the principality of liechtenstein, stabroek and swansea are all classified as a europe

Based on these new examples, I can observe that the task is asking for instance hypernyms for entities on different levels of specificity. The instances of hypernyms can be a specific place, role, or type such as edirne, stabroek, clichy-la-garenne, and songwriter williams. However, it can also be more generalized concepts such as territory, port, geographical region, and urban center.

******
These examples show that the instances of hypernyms can also be different types of geographical features such as mountains, archipelago and urban centers. In a case of Modigliani, the instance of hypernym is a painter which is an occupation. These additional examples further confirm that the task is asking for a specific type, role, or a more generalized concept that the given entity belongs to.

I will use this information to sort the candidate answers based on their relevance

Based on the given examples, I recognize the pattern that the tail entity to be predicted is a word that has a derivational relationship with the given entity. I will use this way of thinking and the information from the examples to help sort the candidate answers for the goal question. In addition, I will continue to look for supplementary information that can help me mine potential relationships between the given entity and the candidate answers.

Based on the given examples with supplementary information, I recognize that some entities have multiple relationships, such as derivational relationships and hypernym relationships. I will consider these relationships as I sort the candidate answers for the goal question. The given example with "glade" and "clear" also suggests that the direction of the relationship can be reversed. I will keep this information in mind while completing the sorting task.

I will keep these additional examples and supplementary information in mind while thinking about the task. From the given examples, I can see that the task involves predicting a word that is related to the given word in a certain way, such as _derivationally_related_form or _also_see.

I can also use the supplementary information to help with the task. For example, if the task is to predict the _also_see of a certain word, then the

These additional examples will help me further understand the task, specifically the concept of _derivationally\_related\_form_. From these examples, I can see that the task involves predicting a word that is related to the given word in a specific way. The word should be a form of the given word that can be derived from it through morphological processes.

For instance, in the first example, the answer is "registrar" which is a word that is related to "

These additional examples can help me understand the supplementary information provided earlier.

I will also consider that for some words, the derivationally\_related form may be related to the original word by a change in affix and potentially a change in tense, part of speech or meaning.

I will keep in mind that for some words, the _derivationally\_related\_form_ may not change the word but be the same word. And for some other words, it may change the word, for example, through a change in affix.

Based on this, I can infer that Woody Guthrie's hypernym might be related to his profession or role as a musician, activist, or singer-songwriter. Therefore, the answer "troubadour" seems to be a plausible answer for the goal question.

From these additional examples, I can see that the hypernym of an entity can describe its larger geographical or political context, such as a European nation or a national capital.

In the context of Woody Guthrie, the hypernym "troubadour" could describe a performer who travels from place to place singing and playing music. However, I will need to consider the other candidate answers in relation to this context in order to sort them effectively.

From these examples, I see that the hypernym of an entity can provide a more general category for it. For example, the hypernym of "Severn River" is "river" and the hypernym of "Columbia University" is "university."

From these examples, I can see that the "instance hypernym" refers to the more specific category or type of the given entity. For instance, "daniel" is a book, "lennon" is a songwriter, and "yellow river" is a river.

In the case of "woody guthrie", the "instance hypernym" would refer to the specific type or category of person he is. We need to find the answer that best describes his profession

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (take, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _also_see of take? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

From the examples, I understand that I am to predict the tail entity of a given relationship by completing the sentence "what is the \_also\_see of [entity]?" The correct answer is provided for each example, and I can use these answers to infer the relationship between the entities and determine the correct order of the candidate answers. In this case, I will use the given entity "take" and the answer "take down" to infer that the relationship is "also\_see" and

The answer is ". The answer is purchase, so the [MASK] is purchase. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
The supplementary information provided in the examples gives me additional context regarding different relationships and how they can be used to predict the tail entity. In this case, I will use the relationships "synset\_domain\_topic\_of" and "hypernym" to predict the tail entities in a similar way as I used the "also\_see" relationship earlier. I will keep this information in mind while I sort the candidate answers for the goal question.

******
These additional examples further illustrate the relationship between entities using the "also\_see" relationship. In each case, the given entity and the correct answer are used to infer a relationship that can be used to predict the correct candidate answer. I will keep these examples in mind and use the same methodology to sort the candidate answers for the goal question.

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (masculine, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _also_see of masculine? The answer is ". The answer is manly, so the [MASK] is manly. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (soft, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _also_see of soft? The answer is ".

The answer is ". The answer is slip by, so the [MASK] is slip by. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
These additional examples show that the "also\_see" relationship can be used to infer different relationships between entities, not just synonyms. For instance, "masculine" is related to "manly", "important" is related to "critical", and "glide" is related to "slip by". I will keep this in mind while I sort the candidate answers for the goal question and use the "also\_see" relationship to infer the correct relationship and order the candidate

******
These additional examples demonstrate that the "also\_see" relationship can be used to infer a variety of different relationships between entities. For instance, "inconclusive" is related to "undetermined", "moral" is related to "good", "weigh" is related to "matter to", and "uncheerful" is related to "joyless". I will keep this in mind as I sort the candidate answers for the goal question and use the "also\_

******
I have analyzed the additional examples provided and find that they follow a pattern similar to the previous examples, where the "also\_see" relationship can be used to infer different relationships between entities. In these examples, I see that "repose" is related to "rest on", "unconscious" is related to "unaware", "honorable" is related to "true", and "right" is related to "true".

The answer is ". The answer is valuable, so the [MASK] is valuable. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
In these examples, I can see that the "also\_see" relationship is used to infer a variety of different relationships between entities. In the first example, "courageous" is related to "bold", in the second example "tip" is related to "upset", in the third "put" is related to "put through", and in the final example, "worthy" is related to "valuable".

The answer is ". The answer is honourable, so the [MASK] is honourable. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
I have carefully considered these additional examples, and I understand that they demonstrate that the "also\_see" relationship can signify a number of different relationships between entities. In these examples, "hurtle" is related to "drop anchor", "independent" is related to "separate", "advantageous" is related to "expedient", and "just" is related to "honourable".

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (same, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _also_see of same? The answer is ".

The answer is ". The answer is inconstant, so the [MASK] is inconstant. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
These additional examples illustrate that the "also\_see" relationship can represent various relationships between entities. I observe in these examples that "same" is connected to "equal", "unclean" is related to "untidy", "march" is tied to "progress", and "unfaithful" is connected to "inconstant." I understand I must apply this understanding of the "also\_see" relationship to order the candidate answers based on their potential relationships to the given entity "

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (virtuous, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _also_see of virtuous? The answer is ".

The answer is unsubdivided, so the [MASK] is unsubdivided. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (easy, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _also_see of easy?

The answer is soft, so the [MASK] is soft. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (comprehensible, _also_see of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _also_see of comprehensible? The answer is ". The answer is clear, so the [MASK] is clear. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
These additional examples demonstrate that the "also\_see" relationship can be used to represent a range of relationships between entities. In these examples, "virtuous" has a relationship with "chaste", "rough" relates to "unsubdivided", "easy" is associated with "soft", and "comprehensible" connects to "clear". I will take note of this pattern as I consider how the "also\_see" relationship may relate to the tail entity for

These examples suggest that the "also\_see" relationship may not always imply a clear or consistent relationship between the given entity and the tail entity. The answers in these examples seem to be loosely connected, if at all, with the given entities.

In the first example, "eat" is related to "polish off," which could suggest a relationship related to consumption or completion. The second example shows "joyous" related to "regimentation," which seems unrelated

This information can help me sort the candidate answers for the original question by looking for a candidate answer that represents a higher level of abstraction in the taxonomy that includes "vomiting" as a type.

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (jew's-ears, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of jew's-ears? The answer is ". The answer is jelly fungus, so the [MASK] is jelly fungus. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (motorization, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of motorization?

The answer is ". The answer is unconsciousness, so the [MASK] is unconsciousness. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
From the additional examples, I can see that hypernyms can also be used to describe more abstract concepts, such as "implementation" for "motorization", or "unconsciousness" for "comatoseness". This reinforces the idea that the hypernym for "vomiting" should be a more abstract concept that encompasses the various types of "vomiting".

From the additional examples, I can see that hypernyms can also describe the broader category or type of an abstract concept, such as "semantic relation" for "part to whole relation" or "performance" for "trick". This reinforces the idea that I should look for a hypernym that represents a more abstract concept that encompasses the different types of "vomiting". I will keep this in mind while sorting the candidate answers for the original question.

From these examples, I can see that hypernyms can describe broader categories or domains that an entity belongs to. For instance, "dita bark" is a type of "tree", "modernize" is a type of "change", "textual criticism" is a type of "literary criticism", and "walk" is a type of "play".
