The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (trade name, _member_of_domain_usage of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _member_of_domain_usage of trade name? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (telephone, _verb_group of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _verb_group of telephone? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Based on the examples provided, I can see a pattern where the [MASK] entity in each example is the same as the answer to the question "what is the _verb_group of [given phrase]?" This suggests that for the goal question, I should sort the candidate answers according to their relevance as a verb group for the given phrase "telephone." Additionally, the examples show a variety of verb forms such as "take," "develop," "switch," and "give

From the additional examples provided, I can see that I should also take into account the outlined relations in order to sort the candidate answers. This means that I should prioritize candidates that have a _synset\_domain\_topic\_of_ relation with "telephone" as "telephony", and candidates that are _derivationally\_related\_form_ to "telephone" as "telephone set".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (brasov, _instance_hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _instance_hypernym of brasov? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

******
From the given examples, I can see a pattern of predicting the hypernym entity for a given entity. The hypernym entity is a more general category that the given entity belongs to. In the first example, the entity "erin" is a more specific instance of the hypernym entity "ireland". Similarly, in the second example, "marlene dietrich" is a specific instance of the hypernym entity "vocalizer".

Based on this pattern, I can

Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (rumania, _has_part of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _has_part of rumania? The answer is ". The answer is brasov, so the [MASK] is brasov. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
From the supplementary information given, I can gather that the relationship between the entity "rumania" and its part "brasov" implies a hierarchical structure. Rumania is a larger entity that has Brasov as one of its parts.

This additional information can help me better understand the context and the relationships between different entities, which can be useful in sorting the candidate answers for the goal question.

******
From these additional examples, I can see that the hypernym entities can vary in their level of specificity. For example, "playwright" is a more specific hypernym entity than "writer", while "geographical region" is a more general hypernym entity than "collection".

This variation in the level of specificity of hypernym entities can be useful to consider when sorting the candidate answers for the goal question. I will keep this in mind as I perform the sorting task

From these additional examples, I can see that the hypernym entities can be related to geography, culture, and other domains. The hypernym entity "european nation" for the entity "principality of liechtenstein" suggests a geographical and political context, while the hypernym entity "songwriter" for the entity "williams" suggests a cultural and artistic context.

These different domains of hypernym entities can be useful to consider when sorting the candidate

In addition to the different domains of hypernym entities, I can also observe that the level of specificity can vary within the same domain. For example, the hypernym entity "urban center" for the entity "edirne" is a more general category than the hypernym entity "suburbia" for the entity "clichy-la-garenne".

These variations in the level of specificity and the domains of hypernym entities can be useful in sorting

From these examples, I can see that there are different levels of specificity in the domain of urban centers, from more general categories like "urban center" to more specific categories like "suburbia" and "range of mountains". I also observe that there are different domains for the hypernym entities, such as the cultural domain for the entity "modigliani" where the hypernym entity is "painter".

Based on the given examples, I will summarize the pattern of reasoning as follows:

1. Identify the domain of the given entity and determine the relationship between the entity and its hypernym in that domain.
2. Consider the specificity of the hypernym entity and compare it to the specificity of the given entity.
3. Use the given examples of similar entities and their hypernyms to inform the reasoning process and determine the most likely hypernym for the given entity.

From the given examples, I can see that the _instance\_hypernym_ relation is used to describe a specific instance or type of a broader category. For instance, the "severn river" is a specific river, while "columbia university" is a specific university and "kean" is a specific thespian.

The hypernym for each of these entities is a more general category that describes the type of the given entity. For instance, the hypernym for "

Based on the given examples, the hypernym refers to a broader category or concept that encompasses the given entity. For instance, the hypernym of "oceanica" is "archipelago" because an archipelago is a broader grouping of islands, of which oceanica is a member. Similarly, the hypernym of "daniel" is "book" because a book is a broader category that may contain characters like Daniel. The same logic applies to the hyper

From the additional analogies provided, I can see that the hypernym of an entity can be a more general concept or category that includes the entity. I should consider the level of generality when sorting the candidate answers in the context of the question, as the correct answer may be a broader or narrower concept depending on the given entity. Additionally, I should be aware of the domain or context of the entity, as the hypernym could be a term that is specific to a certain field or

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers in order of relevance to the goal question.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (grant, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of grant? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Yes, I understand. I will carefully read and analyze the examples, and use them to inform my understanding of the goal question and the relationships between the entities. I will also look for supplementary information that may be helpful in sorting the candidate answers. Once I have processed the examples, I will memorize any relevant information and wait for your signal before providing the sorted list of candidate answers.

Based on the examples provided, I can see that the goal question is asking me to predict the hypernym of a given entity. In each example, the entity is presented along with a relationship (indicated by the "_hypernym of" phrasing), and my task is to complete the sentence by providing the hypernym. I can also see that the examples cover a range of entity types, from objects and body parts to more abstract concepts. This suggests that I should be prepared to handle a variety

From the supplementary information provided, I can see that the entity "grant" has a derivationally related form that is also "grant". This suggests that the entity "grant" is a standalone term that is not derived from another word.

I also see that "grant-in-aid" is a hypernym of "grant", which means that "grant-in-aid" is a broader term that encompasses "grant". This

Based on the additional examples provided, I can see that the hypernyms of the given entities can be more specific than the examples I was given earlier. For instance, "genus caretta" is a hypernym of "reptile genus", and "hipsters" is a hypernym of "youth subculture". This suggests that I should be prepared to handle cases where the hypernym is a more specific term that captures a particular aspect of the given entity.

These analogy examples suggest that the task is to identify the generic category or hypernym of the given entity. The first example demonstrates that "jew's-ears" belongs to the category of "jelly fungus." The second example shows that "motorization" is a type of "implementation." The third example indicates that "hydrogen carbonate" is a part of the broader category of "carbonate." Lastly, "comatoseness"

These examples suggest that the task is to identify the hypernym or superordinate category of the given entity. Here are some ways of thinking and helpful information to remember from these examples for the sorting task:

1. Puerility is a type of immaturity, so when identifying the hypernym, consider the broader category that the given entity belongs to.
2. Part to whole relation is a type of semantic relation, so think about the general category that the given entity

Based on these additional examples, I will consider the different types of entities and their potential hypernyms, and the variations in word usage that may affect the prediction.

For instance, the "genus caretta" example deals with a scientific concept, "hipsters" deals with a social subculture, and "piece" deals with a general concept. The answer "exchange" for the word "break" is an example of a prediction that requires a broader understanding of the context

In addition to the previously considered factors, I will take into account scientific terminology and chemical compounds in these new examples.

For instance, "jew's-ears" is a type of jelly fungus, and "hydrogen carbonate" is a type of carbonate. The answer "implementation" for "motorization" and "unconsciousness" for "comatoseness" demonstrate the use of more abstract concepts as hypernyms.

From these examples, I can see that the system can predict hypernyms for various types of entities including actions, abstract concepts, and groups of people. The system can handle entities such as "freeze" and "expensiveness" that have a specific meaning and can correctly identify the higher level category for them such as "put under" and "price" respectively.

It's worth noting that the system can also predict hypernyms for entities that are not common words, such

I understand. I will keep thinking about the analogy examples provided and use them to guide my sorting of the candidate answers for the given goal question.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers in order of relevance to the goal question.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (order casuarinales, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of order casuarinales? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers in order of relevance to the goal question.
******
The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (get out, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of get out? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.
******
Yes, I understand. I will carefully read and analyze the examples provided, looking for patterns, relationships, and any other relevant information that can help me sort the candidate answers for the goal question. I will remain silent while examples are being given and will wait for your instruction before outputting the sorted list.

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (make, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of make? The answer is ". The answer is modify, so the [MASK] is modify. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (physical object, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of physical object? The answer is ". The answer is physical entity, so the [MASK] is physical entity. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (garnet, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of garnet? The answer is ". The answer is transparent gem, so the [MASK] is transparent gem. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (caudate nucleus, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of caudate nucleus? The answer is ". The answer is basal ganglion, so the [MASK] is basal ganglion. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the examples provided, I will look for the hypernym of "get out" by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of get out?" The pattern in the examples suggests that I should consider the given context, which is "[MASK] _hypernym of get out." Based on this, I will look for a word that represents a higher level of abstraction or category for the action or process of "getting out."

The supplementary information could also provide
******
Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (get out, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of get out? The answer is ". The answer is evasion, so the [MASK] is evasion. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (evasion, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of evasion? The answer is ". The answer is get out, so the [MASK] is get out. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the additional information provided, I will consider not only the hypernym but also the derivationally related form of "get out" in order to find the answer. The supplementary information shows that "evasion" is a derivationally related form of "get out," which suggests that I may need to consider the relationship between these two words as part of the answer.

In summary, to sort the candidate answers for the goal question, I will consider both the hypernym and

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (genus caretta, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of genus caretta? The answer is ". The answer is reptile genus, so the [MASK] is reptile genus. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (hipsters, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of hipsters? The answer is ". The answer is youth subculture, so the [MASK] is youth subculture. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (piece, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of piece? The answer is ". The answer is portion, so the [MASK] is portion. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (break, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of break? The answer is ". The answer is exchange, so the [MASK] is exchange. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
The examples suggest that the hypernym of a given term could be a higher level category or classification that encompasses the term, such as "reptile genus" for "genus caretta" or "youth subculture" for "hipsters." These hypernyms provide a broader context for understanding the given term.

Moreover, the examples also indicate that in some cases, the hypernym may not be a single word, but a phrase that captures the essence

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (jew's-ears, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of jew's-ears? The answer is ". The answer is jelly fungus, so the [MASK] is jelly fungus. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (motorization, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of motorization?

The answer is carbonate, so the [MASK] is carbonate. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (comatoseness, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of comatoseness? The answer is ". The answer is unconsciousness, so the [MASK] is unconsciousness. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
The examples show a wide range of hypernyms, from specific categories such as "jelly fungus" for "jew's-ears" to more general concepts such as "unconsciousness" for "comatoseness." These examples suggest that I should look for a hypernym that accurately captures the essence of "get out" while providing a suitable level of abstraction. The hypernym of "get out" could be a general concept that encompasses various

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (puerility, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of puerility? The answer is ". The answer is immaturity, so the [MASK] is immaturity. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (part to whole relation, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of part to whole relation? The answer is ". The answer is semantic relation, so the [MASK] is semantic relation. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (neomycin, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of neomycin? The answer is ". The answer is antibiotic drug, so the [MASK] is antibiotic drug. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (trick, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of trick? The answer is ". The answer is performance, so the [MASK] is performance. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
The last set of examples suggests that the hypernym of a given term could be a more abstract concept that provides a broader context for understanding the term. For example, "part to whole relation" is a specific type of "semantic relation," just as "neomycin" is a specific type of "antibiotic drug." Moreover, the hypernym can be related to the field or domain of the given term.

Therefore, in order to find the hypernym of "

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (collage film, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of collage film? The answer is ". The answer is picture show, so the [MASK] is picture show. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (fisherman's lure, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of fisherman's lure? The answer is ". The answer is lure, so the [MASK] is lure. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (yelling, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of yelling? The answer is ". The answer is yell, so the [MASK] is yell. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (diesel locomotive, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of diesel locomotive? The answer is ". The answer is railway locomotive, so the [MASK] is railway locomotive. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
The first example shows that a "collage film" is a type of "picture show," indicating that the hypernym could be a broader category or genre that includes the given term. The second and third examples demonstrate that the hypernym can be a more general term that encompasses the given term's meaning. In the fourth example, "diesel locomotive" is a type of "railway locomotive," which suggests that I should look for a hypernym that

The answer is ". The answer is set, so the [MASK] is set. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on these examples, I will try to identify a hypernym that is a broad category or concept that encompasses the given term "get out." I will also consider relationships and other contextual information provided in the examples to help me identify the most accurate and relevant hypernym.

Examples used to analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (run, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of

The answer is ". The answer is venture, so the [MASK] is venture. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (tower, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of tower? The answer is ". The answer is structure, so the [MASK] is structure. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (ecclesiastical benefice, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of ecclesiastical benefice? The answer is ". The answer is spiritualty, so the [MASK] is spiritualty. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
These examples suggest that the hypernym could be a more general or broader concept that encompasses the given term while also providing some context to the term. In the first example, an "abortionist" is a type of "physician," which is a broader concept that provides context to the given term. Similarly, in the second example, a "venture" is a broader concept that encompasses a "suspect" and provides context. In the third example, a "

The answer is ". The answer is play, so the [MASK] is play. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on the examples, it seems that the hypernym is a more general category or concept that includes the given entity. For instance, in the first example, "dita bark" is a type of "tree" and in the second example, "modernize" is a type of "change."

Similarly, for the given question, "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (get out, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "

The answer is ". The answer is people, so the [MASK] is people. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
These examples suggest that finding the hypernym of a term involves identifying a more general category or concept that encompasses that term. In the first example, "put under" is a more general concept that includes "freeze." Similarly, in the second example, "price" is a more general concept that includes "expensiveness." In the third example, "royalty" is a more general concept that includes "saxe-coburg-gotha." Finally,

The answer is ". The answer is screen, so the [MASK] is screen. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
These examples suggest that finding the hypernym of a term may require understanding the context in which it is used, as well as any relationships that the term may have with other entities. In some cases, the hypernym may be a more general category or class of objects (such as "give" for "corn" and "screen" for "windshield"). In other cases, the hypernym may require a deeper understanding of the relationships between entities (such as "arthropod genus

From the additional examples provided, I can see that the word "stylize" has a derivationally related form of both "vogue" and "way", and that stylize is a hypernym of "represent". These facts provide additional context for the goal question, and I will use this information to help sort the candidate answers. Specifically, I will consider "vogue" and "way" as possible answers for the goal question, and also consider the relationship between "

From the additional examples provided, it can be seen that sometimes the _derivationally\_related\_form\_of\_ relation results in the same word as the input word. This suggests that the task involves not just identifying a new word that is related to the given word but also considering the possibility that the given word may be the correct answer itself.

Additionally, the relationship between words in these examples may be bidirectional. For instance, "structure" is the derivationally

Thank you for providing the additional supplementary information. Based on these examples, I can see that the same word ("breaking") has been used as both a hypernym and a derivationally related form. This reinforces the idea that the hypernym of a given entity refers to a broader category that the entity belongs to.

Furthermore, the supplementary information shows that entities can have derivationally related forms that are closely related to the original entity. These related forms may

From these examples, I can see that the word "devaluation" has a derivationally related form of "devalue" and that the word "undervalue" also has a derivationally related form of "devaluation". I also see that "devaluation" is a hypernym of "step-down". I will incorporate this

I will keep in mind these additional examples and how they involve different relationships between words. Specifically, I see that the relationship between "record" and "registrar" is not the same as the relationship between "recidivism" and "retrogress" or "nickname" and "soubriquet". In these latter cases, the two words share a common etymological root but differ in usage and meaning. On the other hand, "think" and "

I will consider this possibility when evaluating the candidate answers for the goal question, looking for any answers that suggest a similar sort

These examples suggest that deriving a new word with the suffix "-age" may imply a commercial or service-related concept related to the original word.

Understood, I will analyze these analogous examples as well. From these examples, I can see that the task is to predict a hypernym for the given entity. In the first example, the hypernym of "genus caretta" is "reptile genus" which provides a broader category for the given entity.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (woody guthrie, _instance_hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _instance_hypernym of woody guthrie? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

From the given examples, I can see that the [MASK] in the sentence completion task refers to the hypernym of the given entity. A hypernym is a term that has a broader meaning and includes the given entity. For example, for the entity "Erin", the hypernym "Ireland" is the correct answer because Ireland is a broader term that includes Erin as a part of it.

From the additional information provided, I can see that the hypernym of "Woody Guthrie" is "troubadour". This means that Woody Guthrie can be classified as a type of troubadour.

Using this information and the analogy from the earlier examples, I can infer that the correct answer for the goal question should be the hypernym of "Woody Guthrie" that describes a broader category that includes him. This will help me

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers in order of relevance to the goal question.
******
The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (vomiting, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of vomiting? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

Yes, I understand. I will carefully read and analyze the examples, and summarize the way of thinking and memorize any helpful information for sorting the candidate answers. I will remain silent during example presentation and will wait for your instruction before outputting.

Based on the examples, I will use the hypernymy relationship to sort the candidate answers. To predict the hypernym of vomiting, I will look for a candidate answer that represents a higher level of abstraction in the taxonomy. From the examples, I can see that "modify" is a hypernym of "make", "physical entity" is a hypernym of "physical object", "transparent gem" is a hypernym of "garnet", and

Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (vomit up, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of vomit up? The answer is ". The answer is vomiting, so the [MASK] is vomiting. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (rumination, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of rumination?

******
Based on the supplementary examples, I will consider both the hypernymy and derivationally related form relationships to sort the candidate answers. I will use the hypernymy relationship when the relationship type is explicitly stated as "_hypernym of", and I will use the derivationally related form relationship when the relationship type is explicitly stated as "_derivationally\_related\_form of". The first example indicates that "vomiting" is a derivationally related form of "vom

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (genus caretta, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of genus caretta? The answer is ". The answer is reptile genus, so the [MASK] is reptile genus. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (hipsters, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of hipsters? The answer is ". The answer is youth subculture, so the [MASK] is youth subculture. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (piece, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of piece?

The answer is portion, so the [MASK] is portion. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (break, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of break? The answer is ". The answer is exchange, so the [MASK] is exchange. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
Based on these additional examples, I will continue to use the hypernymy relationship to sort the candidate answers for the "_hypernym of vomiting" question. The example with "genus caretta" shows that the hypernym can be a specialized term (in this case, "reptile genus"). The example with "break" and "exchange" shows that sometimes the hypernym can be a more abstract term that may not have an obvious one-to-one relationship with the given

Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (hematemesis, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of hematemesis? The answer is ". The answer is vomiting, so the [MASK] is vomiting. ". Keep thinking but not output.
******
I will use the information from this supplementary example to inform my sorting of the candidate answers for the "__hypernym of vomiting" question. Since "hematemesis" is also a type of vomiting, the example suggests that "vomiting" can be the hypernym for other terms in this taxonomy. This reinforces the idea that I should look for a term that represents a broader concept than "vomiting" for the answer to this question.
******
Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (jew's-ears, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of jew's-ears? The answer is ". The answer is jelly fungus, so the [MASK] is jelly fungus. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (motorization, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of motorization?

The answer is implementation, so the [MASK] is implementation. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (hydrogen carbonate, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of hydrogen carbonate?

The answer is ". The answer is unconsciousness, so the [MASK] is unconsciousness. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
These examples demonstrate that the provided hypernym can be a more specialized term that falls under a broader category represented by the correct answer. In the first example, "jew's-ears" falls under the category of "jelly fungus". This means that when determining the hypernym for "hematemesis", I should not only consider broad categories like "medical condition" but also consider more specialized terms like "vomiting".

Similarly, in the third example,

The answer is ". The answer is performance, so the [MASK] is performance. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
These examples suggest that I need to consider the hierarchy of concepts and categories when determining the hypernym for "vomiting". The answer should be a broader concept that encompasses various types of vomiting, rather than a specific instance of it.

In the first example, "puerility" falls under the broader category of "immaturity", which makes "immaturity" the hypernym. Similarly, in the third example, "neomycin" is a type of

The answer is ". The answer is railway locomotive, so the [MASK] is railway locomotive. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
These examples suggest that the correct hypernym for the given term is often a broader term that encompasses the given term and potentially other related entities. The answer for the collage film example is a general term for a type of movie, and the answer for the fisherman's lure example is a general term for a type of bait used in fishing. The answer for yelling is a general term for different modes of vocal communication, while the answer for diesel locomotive is

The answer is ". The answer is set, so the [MASK] is set. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
These examples show that the hypernym relationship is a hierarchical relationship between entities, where a specific entity falls under a more general category. For instance, sorrow is a type of unhappiness, and subcontracting is a type of hiring. The correct hypernyms can often be identified by thinking about the broader category to which the given entity belongs.

In the context of predicting the hypernym for "vomiting", we are looking for a hypernym that represents a

The answer is ". The answer is spiritualty, so the [MASK] is spiritualty. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
These examples demonstrate the hierarchical relationship between entities and their hypernyms. In some cases, the hypernym represents a broad category, such as "structure" for "tower" or "spiritualty" for "ecclesiastical benefice". In other cases, the hypernym may represent a more specific category that includes the given entity, such as "physician" for "abortionist" or "venture" for "suspect".

These examples demonstrate that the hypernym can be a more general category or concept that encompasses the given entity. For example, "dita bark" is a specific object, and its hypernym "tree" represents a broader category of plant life. Similarly, "modernize" is a specific action related to changing something, and its hypernym "change" represents a more general concept. In the case of "textual criticism", its hypernym "literary criticism" represents a broader

These examples show that the hypernym of a given term can be a more general category or concept that encompasses the term, such as "put under" being the hypernym of "freeze" or "price" being the hypernym of "expensiveness". In the case of "saxe-coburg-gotha" and "nationality", the hypernym "royalty" and "people" respectively, represents a higher level of abstraction

Based on the given examples, I have noted that the hypernym of a word can be a more abstract or general term that encompasses the given word. The examples also suggest that the hypernym can represent a broader category or class of objects, actions, or concepts.
