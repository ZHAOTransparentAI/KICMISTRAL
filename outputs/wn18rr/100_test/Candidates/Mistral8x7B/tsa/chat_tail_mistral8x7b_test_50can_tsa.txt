Thank you for providing additional examples for analogy. From these examples, I notice that the tail entity can be a derivationally related form of the given word, and can be a verb or noun form of the given word, or a root word of the given word.

However, I will still remain silent and wait for your permission to output the sorted list of candidate answers.

The list of candidate answers is [modify,shift,sublime,weaken,meliorate,change,convert,vary,chemistry,turn,relax,recuperate,loosen,war machine,isomerize,meliorate,transmutation,refine,switch,slacken,decimalize,switch,shape up,isomerize,metrify,lessen,trained worker,music,trade,sublimate,shoot,unbend,slacken,wither,slow up,sublime,switch over,written material,decimalize,concentrate,arthropod family,physics,walk,refine,young woman,blur,collection,gather,oxidize,maths]. And the question is predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (transmutation, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a word derivated from the word transmutation? The answer is ". Now, based on the previous examples and your own knowledge and thinking, sort the list to let the candidate answers which are more possible to be the true answer of the question more prior. Output the sorted order of candidate answers using the format "[most possible answer | second possible answer | ... | least possible answer]" and please start your response with "The final order:". Do not output anything except the final order. Note your output sorted order should contain all the candidates in the list but not add new answer to it.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (ski, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word ski? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

I understand that the examples provided are similar to the goal question and can be used to analogy the potential meaning of the goal question. In each example, the task is to predict the tail entity that can be derived from the given word. The tail entity is a derivationally related form of the given word. The supplementary information provided is the word that can be derived from the given word. To sort the candidate answers for the goal question, I will apply the following way of thinking:

I will continue to think about these examples and what I have learned from them, but I will not output anything until given the goal question and a list of candidate answers to sort. This will help me to focus on the task at hand and provide the most accurate response. In the meantime, I will remember that the hypernym of relationship involves broader categories, such as "people" being the hypernym of "nationality

I understand. By analyzing these examples, I can infer that the task requires me to predict the broader category or hypernym for the given entity. The examples showcase various types of entities, such as verbs, physical objects, gems, and body parts, to emphasize the general nature of the task. I will use this analogy to sort the candidate answers for the goal question. The key idea here is to find the hypernym or broader category for the given entity in the context

******
From the supplementary information provided in the examples, it is clear that understanding the context of the given word, such as derivationally related forms and broader categories, is important for generating the correct answer. In these examples, I see that host is derived from master of ceremonies, and innkeeper is another word related to host. Additionally, junket and emcee have a broader category of host. I will consider this context and information when sorting the candidate answers for the goal question.

******
These additional examples help strengthen my understanding of the task at hand. They emphasize the importance of considering the broader category for each given entity, including even more diverse concepts such as animal genera, youth subcultures, portions, and exchanges. This confirms that my approach to the goal question should involve determining the suitable hypernym or broader category for the given entity in the provided context. I will maintain this understanding while sorting the candidate answers.

With this new supplementary information, I further understand the relationship between words that are derivationally related. It highlights the fact that words can be derived from one another, such as host being derivable from innkeeper, and master of ceremonies being derivable from host. This reinforces the fact that determining relations among given words is crucial for generating the accurate response. The provided examples will help guide my analysis as I proceed to sort the candidate answers for the given goal question.

These new examples further emphasize and broaden the scope of the task at hand, which is to consider the appropriate hypernym or broader category for the given entity. The examples introduce jelly fungus, implementation, carbonate, and unconsciousness as possible broader categories for various entities, making the task even more universal in its application. I will maintain this perspective as I proceed to sort the candidate answers for the original goal question, upholding the understanding of hypernymy and broader categories.

These final examples further solidify the notion that a variety of entities must be considered in the broader context of their semantic relationships. By providing examples such as puerility, semantic relation, antibiotic drug, and performance, I now understand that the task of identifying a hypernym or broader category can apply to abstract concepts and semantic relations as well. With this comprehensive understanding, I am well-prepared and confident in my ability to sort the candidate answers for the original goal question,

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (hostility, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a word derivated from the word hostility? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting.

From the examples provided, I understand that the goal question is asking for a word that can be derived from the given word, which may or may not be directly related to the given word. I will use this understanding to carefully consider each candidate answer and sort them based on their relevance and potential as a derived word from the given "hostility" prompt. I will also remember any extra information that may be helpful in determining the relevance of the candidate answers.

From the supplementary information provided, I understand that the word "hostility" may be directly related to the given prompt for the goal question, as it has been mentioned in the examples as a possible answer to related prompts. I will take this into account when sorting the candidate answers, as they will be expected to be related to "hostility." I will also remember that the word "action" was given as a broader category for "hostility," which could potentially inform the sorting

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers in order of relevance to the goal question.

I understand. Based on the examples, the task is to predict the tail entity of the given tuple by determining the broader category or hypernym of the second entity, which is indicated by the phrase "_hypernym of". The given examples show that the tail entity can be inferred based on the relationship between the broader category of the second entity and the first entity. I will keep this thinking in mind for the sorting task.

I understand. The supplementary information in the examples provides additional context regarding the relationship between the entities in the tuple. The first supplementary example indicates that the tail entity can be a "part or a member" of the second entity, which is referred to as a "_member\_meronym of". The second and third supplementary examples use the relationship "_derivationally\_related\_form of" to indicate that the tail entity can be a form of the second entity or vice versa.

Based on the additional examples, I see that the hypernym of the second entity can be a more general category that encompasses the second entity. The first example indicates that a broader category for "genus caretta" is "reptile genus". Similarly, the second example indicates that a broader category for "hipsters" is "youth subculture". This suggests that for the original question, I should look for a broader category for the word "number". The last two examples

The first example suggests that a broader category for "corn" is "give". However, this answer seems to be incorrect based on the usual meaning of "hypernym" as a broader category. Therefore, we need to reconsider this example to determine if it is a valid analogy.

The second example suggests that a broader category for "genus cancer" is "arthropod genus", which is also not a valid hypernym.

The third example indicates that

Understood, from these additional examples, I can see that the relationship between the given word and the derived word is often not simply a matter of appending a prefix or suffix, but can involve a more complex relationship, such as a specific type of action associated with the given word, or a word that shares a common root.

I will keep in mind the supplemental information provided as I analyze the examples. I see that in some examples, the tail entity is the same as the provided word, and in others, it is a derivationally related form.

From the examples provided, I see that in addition to the relationship of "derivationally related form" between the provided word and the tail entity, it is also possible to have the same word as the tail entity.

I also notice that the relationship between the words is not limited to "derivationally related form", but other relationships like "_hypernym of" may also be present, which may influence the assignment of the tail entity.

From the additional information provided, I understand that the tail entity can be determined not only by the "derivationally related form" relationship but also by broader categories of the provided words, in this case, "praise".

So when I approach the sorting task for the candidate answers, I will consider both of these relationships between the provided word and the tail entity and any other relevant information that may help me to prioritize and sort the candidate answers.

I will consider not only the "derivationally related form" relationship between the provided word and the tail entity but also the broader categories of the provided words and any other relationships that may be present.

I will keep in mind that the relationship between the provided word and the tail entity could also be their derivationally related forms, and also their stems, basing on examples. And it's worth noting that words like "hold" and "incubator" have their lemma form as the same as their base form.

In summary, as I approach the sorting task, I will consider both the "derivationally related form" relationship and any other relevant relationships

In the examples provided, the relationship between the given words and the tail entities were derivationally related forms of the provided words. In some examples (calcium, organize and interrelationship) the tail entities were the verbs related to given words.

Thank you for providing the examples. Based on these examples, I can infer that the goal question is asking for a component or constituent of the word "watt second" that can fill in the blank [MASK]. The word "watt second" is a unit of energy or action in physics, so the candidate answers should be related to this concept. I will keep this thinking in mind while sorting the candidate answers.

Thank you for the additional information. This confirms my previous understanding that the word "watt second" is a unit of energy or action in physics. The fact that "watt second" is a hyponym of "work unit" means that it is a specific type of work unit. I will keep this in mind while sorting the candidate answers, as any components or constituents of "watt second" should also be related to the concept of work units or energy.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (basketball court, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word basketball court? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

Understood, I will keep thinking about these examples and the analogy to the goal question, but I will not output my thinking yet. Based on the examples, the goal question involves predicting the hypernym or broader category of the word "basketball court." From the given examples, it appears that I should consider the relationships between specific objects and their broader categories. This involves identifying commonalities and broader categories that may apply to the given entity. In the first example, "make"

From the examples, I observe that the goal is to predict a broader category or hypernym of a given entity. The candidate answer is provided and I need to sort it based on whether it is a valid hypernym or a broader category of the given entity. The provided examples also demonstrate different categories of entities from objects to body parts to precious stones, implying that I should apply a general understanding of hierarchical relationships and taxonomy rather than relying on specific knowledge of any particular domain.

From the supplemental information, I gather that there are two types of relationships given in the new examples, namely hypernym relationship and derivationally related form. The examples also show that the same word can be both a derivationally related form and a hypernym of another word. To sort the candidate answers, I need to determine which of them has a hypernym or derivationally related form relationship with the given entity, and whether the candidate answer is a broader category of the given entity.

The additional examples also confirm that the relationship between the candidate answer and the given entity is one of hypernym relationship, where the candidate answer is a broader category of the given entity. The examples also indicate that the given entities can be words from various domains, such as animals, subculture, objects, and actions, and therefore, the candidate answer should be a hypernym that is also a broader category across all domains.

The additional supplemental information confirms that I should consider derivationally related forms as well as hypernyms when determining the candidate answer.

These examples help me understand that the task involves finding the hypernym or a broader category of the given entity, and this category can belong to various domains such as biology, engineering, chemistry, and medicine.

From the examples, I can see that in this task, I need to predict the hypernym or a broader category for each given entity. I need to be familiar with various domains such as biology, physics, and engineering, as well as different types of word relationships, including derivationally related forms and hypernyms. I also need to consider the context of the question and the answer choices to give the most accurate prediction. Additionally, if the given entity is already a broad category or hyper

I understand the format of the sentences and that the goal is to predict a hypernym of the given entity. From the examples I can see that the hypernym can be a more general term that encompasses the given entity. For example, for "diesel locomotive" the hypernym is "railway locomotive" which is a more general term that includes all types of locomotives, not just diesel-powered ones. Similarly, for "yelling"

These examples demonstrate that the task involves predicting a hypernym for a given word, which can be a broader category in a taxonomy or hierarchy. The examples cover a range of categories including occupations (abortionist, physician), actions (suspect, venture), building structures (tower, structure), and religious terms (ecclesiastical benefice, spiritualty). The task requires understanding the various shades of meaning and relationships between different words. I should consider not only the

These examples show that predicting the hypernym of a word involves identifying a broader category that encompasses the meaning of that word. For example, the hypernym of "dita bark" is "tree," which is a broader category that includes various types of barks, such as dita bark. Similarly, the hypernym of "modernize" is "change," which is a broader category that includes various types of changes, such as modernizing. I should apply this understanding to

From the given examples, I can see that the hypernym of a word can be thought of as a broader or more general category for that word. For instance, the hypernym of "freeze" is "put under", as putting something under can include freezing, but not vice versa. Similarly, the hypernym of "expensiveness" is "price", as the concept of price is more general than expensiveness.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (freight, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word freight? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task. During I give examples please keep silent until I let you output.

I understand the analogy pattern in the examples provided. The task is to predict the tail entity (a hypernym) given the relation "hypernym of" and a head entity (a specific instance or a subclass). By carefully examining each example, I will extract useful information such as:

1. Hypernyms can belong to a more general category or domain (modify > make, physical entity > physical object, transparent gem > garnet, basal gangl

From the supplementary information provided, I observe the following:

1. If the given relation is "derivationally\_related\_form," the desired answer is a word that can be derived from the original word or a word that can form the original word through derivation.
2. In this particular context, freight seems to be the base word for derivation leading to freightage, which is then a related form. The answer merchantman is also derivationally related

Thank you for providing additional examples. The common pattern in these examples suggests that the tail entity should be a hypernym or a broader category of the given entity.

To summarize, the way of thinking for this task involves:

1. Identifying the given entity in the prompt
2. Predicting a hypernym or a broader category for the given entity

With this line of thinking, we can sort the candidate answers for the goal question by prioritizing options that

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (wive, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word wive? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.

I understand the analogy. In each example, the task is to predict the tail entity that can be a broader category of the given entity, which is identified by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word [entity]? The answer is ". Based on the provided examples, it seems that the tail entity should represent a more general or abstract concept that encompasses the given entity. I will keep this thinking in mind for the sorting task.

I have analyzed the additional examples and will use them to further guide my thinking for the sorting task. The new examples reinforce the pattern observed in the initial ones, where the tail entity is a broader category that encompasses the given entity. However, the new examples also demonstrate that the tail entity can be a type or group of the given entity, rather than a purely abstract or general concept. I will use this expanded understanding to inform my sorting of the candidate answers.

I have reviewed and analyzed the additional examples provided. Based on these examples, I can see that the tail entity can be a more specific type or subcategory of the given entity, rather than always being a more general or abstract concept. For instance, in the case of "motorization," the broader category is an implementation. I will use this broader interpretation to guide my sorting of the candidate answers.

Thank you for the additional examples. From these examples, I can see that the tail entity can also be a type or subcategory of a broader category, rather than just the broader category.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (glade, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a word derivated from the word glade? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

I will keep the examples in mind as I read and analyze them to understand the potential meaning of the goal question and to identify any supplementary information that may be helpful for sorting the candidate answers. The analogous examples suggest that the tail entity [MASK] should be a word that is derived from the given entity. The [MASK] in these examples is not necessarily a single word, but can also be a multi-word phrase. The given example with "hold" and "concurrency"

I will keep the additional examples in mind and use the supplementary information to help me understand the goal question and the relationships between the given entities. The additional examples suggest that a word can be derived from another word through a relationship other than derivationally related, such as hypernym. The examples also show that a word can have multiple derived words, such as "clear" and "glade." I will memorize this information for use in the sorting task.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers in order of relevance to the goal question.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (set up, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a word derivated from the word set up? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

From the given examples, I can infer that the task is to predict the tail entity that can be derived from the given word. The tail entity can be a directly derived word from the given word or a word that can be derived with a slightly different form. In the first example, from the word "set up", the derived word is "effect". Similarly, in the second and third examples, the derived words are "misunderstand" and "concurrency" from the words "m

Based on the supplementary information, I can see that the answers are not necessarily directly derived from the given word. Instead, they can be a broader category or a part of a larger concept. In the first example, from the word "straighten", the hypernym is "set up". Similarly, in the second and fourth examples, the hypernyms are "set up" and "clean" respectively. However, the third example still requires the word to be derived from "placement",

Understood, I will continue to analyze the examples and remember the important information. From the given examples, I can see that the derived word on the `derivationally_related_form` relationship can be directly derived from the given word or have a more complex relationship, such as a word derived from a root word or a word derived from a word with a similar meaning.

Using the information from the given examples, I will now wait for the list of candidate answers for the goal

Based on the supplementary information examples, I can see that for the `hypernym of` relationship, the answer can be a more general term for the given word. For instance, the word "stack" being a hypernym of "set up" indicating that a stack can be a broader category or general concept of set up.

Similarly, from the `derivationally_related_form of` examples, I can see that for this relationship, the answers can be a

From these examples, I can see that the `derivationally_related_form of` relationship represents a word derived from the given word, which can be a longer version, modified form, or more specific term of the given word. And the answer for [MASK] would be this derived word, hence based on this information I will organize the candidate answers for the goal question.

Understood, from these supplementary examples, I can see that:

* The answer for [MASK] in the `hypernym of` relationship can be a broader category or a generalization of the given word.
* The answer for [MASK] in the `derivationally_related_form of` relationship can be a derived word or a form of the given word.

I will use this information to help me sort the candidate answers for the goal question.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers in order of relevance to the goal question.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (healthy, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a word derivated from the word healthy? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

I understand the way of thinking in these examples is to predict the tail entity based on the given entity and its derivationally related form. In the first example, "effect" can be derived from the word "set up" by removing "-tion" to get "set". The second example, "misunderstand" can be derived from the word "misunderstanding" by removing "-ing" to get "misunderstand". In the third example, "concurrency

Examples give supplement information: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (wellness, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a word derivated from the word wellness?

******
From the supplementary examples, I observe that in addition to derivationally related forms, also\_see or related terms can also be used to determine the tail entity. In the first example, "healthy" can be derived from the word "wellness" by removing "-ness" to get "well". In the second example, "robust" can be considered a synonym of "healthy" as they share a similar meaning. Similarly, in the third example, "healthy

From these additional examples, I can see that the tail entity is a word that is derived from the given entity. The answer "registrar" is derived from "record" by adding "-ar" to the end, "retrogress" from "recidivism" by removing the first syllable "re-" and adding "-trogress", and "soubriquet" from "nickname" by replacing the first part with the French word "sou

From the supplement information, I can see that the tail entity can also be determined by using synonyms of the given entities. In the second example, "healthy" is a synonym of "robust", so it is the correct tail entity. This shows that the tail entity is not limited to being a derivationally related form, but can also be a synonym of the given entity.

Based on the given examples, if the tail entity can be derived from the given (healthiness, \_derivationally\_related\_form of , [MASK]), the answer would be health. In this case, healthiness can be derived to health by removing -ness.

I will also keep in mind the other examples provided, such as "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (vomit up, derivationally\_related\_form of , [MASK])", and the information that vomiting is a derivationally related form of vomit up. I will not output anything yet.

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".
******
Yes. I can assist with link prediction and sorting candidate answers in order of relevance to the goal question.

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (top, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a word derivated from the word top? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

I understand. From the examples, I can see that the task involves predicting the tail entity that can be derived from the given word. The tail entity is a word that is derivationally related to the given word. I will use this thinking process to sort the candidate answers for the goal question. Additionally, the examples suggest that the derivationally related form may not always be the expected word, but rather a logical derivative of the given word. I will keep this in mind as well.

From the supplementary information, I can see that the tail entity can sometimes be the same as the given word, such as in the case of "top" and "upside." Additionally, I see that in some cases, the tail entity can be a broader category of the given word, such as when "top" is a hypernym of "pass." I will take these additional relationships into account when sorting the candidate answers for the goal question.

I understand. From the additional examples, I can see that the tail entity can sometimes be a word that is derivationally related to the given word, but not necessarily an expected form of the given word. The relationship between the given word and the tail entity can vary, and may not always be the same. I will use this information to sort the candidate answers for the goal question.

I understand. From these additional examples, I see that the derivational relationship between the given word and the tail entity can vary. In some cases, the tail entity is a more specific form of the given word, such as with "trail" and "trailer" or "stop over" and "stop." In other cases, the tail entity is the same as the given word, such as with "cook" and "touch." I will keep these patterns in mind as I sort
