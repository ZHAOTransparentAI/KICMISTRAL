Thanks for providing more examples. Based on these examples, it seems that the "hypernym of" relationship is used in various contexts, such as in terms of classification, subclassification, subsetting, and subsetting a class into subclasses. The selected "hypernym of" entities are likely to be more general, encompassing categories, or higher-level labels that could contain the original entities as a subset.

Moreover, in some cases, additional information is provided,

I see. Based on these examples, the "hypernym of" relationship can have multiple meanings in different contexts. In some cases, it represents the higher level or more general category encompassing the lower-level category, such as in the case of puerility being the hypernym of immaturity. In others, it may represent a more general concept that includes multiple sub-concepts or sub-classes, such as the part to whole relation being the hypernym of

You are a good assistant to perform link prediction and sorting. Given a goal question and a list of candidate answers of this question. Your need to order these candidate answers in the list to let candiate answers which are more possible to be the answer of the question more prior. If you has known your responsibility, respond "Yes". Otherwise, respond "No". Do not output anything except "Yes" and "No".

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (praise, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of praise? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question. Another part of given facts contain supplementary information, keep capturing these extra information and mining potential relationships among them to help the sorting. Please carfully read, relize and thinking about these examples. Summarize the way of thinking in these examples and memorize the information you think maybe helphul to your sorting task.

The final order:
[most possible answer: pass off | second possible answer: remove | ... | least possible answer: jewelry]

Explanation: The candidates "vanish" and "fall off" are directly related to the question, but these are not likely to be the correct answer as they are not hypernyms of "vanish". The candidates "percipient" and "devise" have no connection with the question and are unlikely to be the correct answer.

Thank you for providing these examples. Based on these examples, it seems that the goal is to predict the tail entity by identifying the instance hypernym of a given entity (in this case, "woody guthrie") in a given sentence. The instance hypernym represents a higher level of abstraction or grouping of similar entities.

By carefully reading and considering the examples, I have extracted several key pieces of information that could be helpful in sorting the candidate answers. First,

Thank you for providing additional information. From these examples, it appears that:

1. The goal: Given a sentence involving a known entity (e.g., "woody guthrie"), predict the instance hypernym of that entity by completing the sentence: "what is the instance hypernym of [entity]?"
2. The approach: Analyze the sentence and identify the target entity [MASK] in the given sentence, then find the instance hypernym that is most closely

Thank you for providing additional examples. From these examples, I have identified the following key points:

1. The target entity [MASK] often appears to be a specific instance or person, such as "yeats" or "caucasus," but in some cases, it may be a more general concept or group, such as "wise men" or "collections."
2. The instance hypernym is used to describe the target entity [MASK] at a higher level of

* "Stabroek" is a specific instance at a higher level of abstraction, and the instance hypernym is "National capital

The list of candidate answers is [law,reader,reading,skimming,literate person,student,wash,speechmaking,read,talking,read,yell,wash,writer,wash,spot,utter,shout,usa,stratify,computing,yakety-yak,imagine,politics,rumourmonger,stain,judaism,tie in,colloquialism,progress,interrelate,wash,wear out,greek mythology,drawing,work,scuttlebutt,sow,incinerate,sow in]. And the question is predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (read, _derivationally_related_form of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _derivationally_related_form of read? The answer is ". Now, based on the previous examples and your own knowledge and thinking, sort the list to let the candidate answers which are more possible to be the true answer of the question more prior. Output the sorted order of candidate answers using the format "[most possible answer | second possible answer | ... | least possible answer]" and please start your response with "The final order:". Do not output anything except the final order. Note your output sorted order should contain all the candidates in the list but not add new answer to it.

The final order:
[law, writer, talking, intersection, incineration, source]
law, writer are not derivationally related to read, intersection is not substantiated, intersection source are not given, intersection source are not computable, intersection source are not contested, incineration source as not given.
[uter, shout] are not derivationally related to read, contested sub intersection source are not contested, contested sub intersection source are contested

The goal question is: predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (vomiting, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "what is the _hypernym of vomiting? The answer is ". To sort the candidate answers, typically you would need to refer to some other examples that may be similar to or related to the question.
 Part of given examples are similar to the goal question, you should analogy them to understand potential meaning of the goal question.
