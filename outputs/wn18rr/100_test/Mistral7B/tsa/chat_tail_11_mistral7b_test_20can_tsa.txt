The examples suggest that the task is to predict the tail entity or result of a word or phrase, such as a trade name or a word used in a specific context or domain. This can be done by completing a sentence that relates the word to its meaning or significance. The examples also show that there are different forms and types of word usage, such as proper noun vs common noun, and that it can be difficult to determine the most likely tail entity.

These examples provide information that predicting the tail entity of a word can be done by completing a sentence that relates it to a broader category or domain of use. These examples illustrate that the tail entity is not necessarily the same as the word itself, and it can be necessary to relate it to a different word or phrase. The examples also suggest that different forms of a word can be associated with different categories or domains of use.

Thank you for providing additional examples. Based on these examples, it seems that often the hypernym may be a general term that includes several more specific subcategories. Therefore, it may be necessary to consider other contextual information to understand the relationship between the hypernym and the words being discussed. It may also be helpful to look at other contextual clues such as the presence of related words or phrases often associated with the hypernym to help narrow down the potential tail entities.

Our analysis of the given examples reveals that some of the tail entities can be synonyms of certain words, while others are related to specific concepts. For instance, "repose" is a synonym of "rest on", "unconscious" is related to "unaware", and "honorable" is related to "true". We can also see that some words have multiple synonyms or related concepts, such as the word "right" which can be related to both "true"

Thank you for providing these additional examples. Analyzing them, we can see that some of the words in the given list (courageous, tip, worthy) are more closely related to their synonyms than others. However, it seems that some words may not have a clear synonym that is a tail entity.

These examples demonstrate that some words may have multiple synonyms or related concepts that could be considered tail entities. For instance, "hurtle" is related to "drop anchor", "independent" is related to "separate", "advantageous" is related to "expedient", and "just" is related to "honourable".

Hypernymy is a relation between words in the category hierarchy of a language. A more general category, called a hypernym, includes more specific categories, called hyponyms. For example, "vehicle" is a hypernym of "car" and "truck," and "car"

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (puerility, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word puerility? The answer is ". The answer is immaturity, so the [MASK] is immaturity. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (part to whole relation, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word part to whole relation? The answer is ". The answer is semantic relation, so the [MASK] is semantic relation. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (neomycin, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word neomycin? The answer is ". The answer is antibiotic drug, so the [MASK] is antibiotic drug. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (trick, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word trick? The answer is ". The answer is performance, so the [MASK] is performance. " Keep thinking but not output.

These examples demonstrate how to analyze hypernymy when the challenge is to identify a broader category of a term. Let me provide my analysis of each example:

1. "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (puerility, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence '[the answer] can be a broader category of the word puerility? The answer is '. The answer is immaturity, so the [MASK] is immaturity."

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (collage film, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word collage film? The answer is ". The answer is picture show, so the [MASK] is picture show. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (fisherman's lure, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word fisherman's lure? The answer is ". The answer is lure, so the [MASK] is lure. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (yelling, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word yelling?

These examples further demonstrate the use of analogy and hypernymy to identify a broader category of a term. Let me analyze each example:

1. "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (collage film, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence '[the answer] can be a broader category of the word collage film? The answer is '. The answer is picture show, so the [MASK] is picture show." In this example, "

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (sorrow, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word sorrow? The answer is ". The answer is unhappiness, so the [MASK] is unhappiness. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (muharrum, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word muharrum? The answer is ". The answer is islamic calendar month, so the [MASK] is islamic calendar month. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (subcontract, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word subcontract?

The answer is hire, so the [MASK] is hire. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (parallelize, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word parallelize? The answer is ". The answer is set, so the [MASK] is set. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
I see what you're trying to get at with these examples. It appears that you're trying to generalize from the given information to identify other epistemological concepts (such as "unhappiness," "Islamic calendar month," "hire," and "set") which are more general categories of the given lexiconical terms ("sorrow," "muharrum," "subcontract," and "parallelize"). This would justify the today's question of

These examples are further clarifying how hypernymy can be used to generalize a lexical item (in this case, related classifications) to a broader category of thought. Here are my thoughts on each example:

1. "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (abortionist, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence '[the

These examples continue to illustrate how hypernymy can be used to identify a broader category of a word (in this case, lexical items that share a common hypernym). Let me provide my analysis:

1. "[The answer] can be a broader category of the word dita bark?": "Tree": By completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word dita bark? The answer is '. The answer is tree, so the [MASK

Continuing with the presented examples, these instances are further highlighting how hypernymy can be employed to generalize a given lexical term into a broader category. Let me analyze each one:

1. "[The answer] can be a broader category of the word freeze?": "Put under": By completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word freeze? The answer is '. The answer is put under, so the [MASK] is put under.

These examples further explore the application of hypernymy to identify a more comprehensive category of a given lexical term. Let's analyze them one by one:

Understood. To clarify, in these examples, you are asking me to complete a sentence by selecting the correct answer from a list of candidate answers. The structure of the sentence is "[answer] can be a broader category of the word [mask]?" and the goal is to predict the appropriate ending that can be a more general category. To accomplish this, we can look at similar patterns in the given examples and use that information to inform our sorting of the candidate answers.

Understood. Based on these examples, it appears that we need to predict a broader category of the given word by completing the given sentence. In each example, the completion of the sentence leads to the identification of the predicted broader category. These examples show that we need to look for words or concepts that are derived from or related to the given word, or are commonly used with the given word.

It's important to note that the given word in these examples is the hypernym, which

In these examples, the given hypernym is used to locate the given word in a broader context. The predicate task is then used to predict a more general concept or category related to the domain. An analogy-based approach is used to make the link from the given word to the corresponding tail entity.

For example, "sorrow" is related to "unhappiness", "muharrum" is related to "Islamic calendar month", "subcontract"

It looks like the examples are still not quite in the right format. These examples seem to fit more into a "match the hyponym" format. The examples show the relationship between the given word, the question, and the possible answers, but they don't quite fit the format of "complete the sentence".

It seems that in the pattern of the previous examples, the question "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given ([word], _hypernym of , [

These examples seem to be even further off from the format of the previous examples. "Complete the sentence" in this form you provide seems to be a suggestion to you in addition to the given examples.

I suggest that predictions of the tail entity predictions for "vomiting" can be:

* Hypernym of: Reflex Condition
* Hypernym of: Reflex activity
* Hypernym of: Reflex action of body

I can see that these examples are a bit different. They are a bit more focused on the relationship between the given word and the words that are different variations of the given word.

In the examples you have provided, it seems like the examples are showing a pattern where the question is "predict the semantic category of the word [word]". The examples are then completed by filling in the blank "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word [word]?" with the answer

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (sorrow, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word sorrow?

These examples seem to fit a specific pattern in a different way of completing the sentence, like you said "perhaps it is different. I suggest that the pattern Is to predict the category of word X that is more general thanaming. The missing element is not given in the examples, but you can probably figure it out based on what the task is supposed to accomplish."

I can see that in these examples, you are filling in the blank "[the answer] can be a broader category of

I see that you're trying to connect the word "abortionist" to a broader category, such as "physician", but I'm not sure why this would be relevant to the task of link prediction. In the previous examples, the missing element was not given in the examples, but you can probably figure it out based on what the task is supposed to accomplish.

Examples used to Analogy: "predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (dita bark, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word dita bark? The answer is ". The answer is tree, so the [MASK] is tree. predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (modernize, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word modernize?

The answer is ". The answer is play, so the [MASK] is play. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
These examples are still a bit different from the format I mentioned earlier. The pattern seems to be that you are trying to find the most general category (or genus) that a given word could belong to. In the given examples:

* Dita bark is a type of tree
* Modernize is a type of change
* Textual criticism is a type of literary criticism
* Walk is a type of play

The answer is ". The answer is people, so the [MASK] is people. " Keep thinking but not output.
******
These examples seem to match the pattern I described earlier. The goal of the pattern is to be able to complete a sentence where the answer category is a "broader category" of the word that is being discussed. In each example, the answer category will be a broader category than the original word being discussed, and the answer will give a specific category that is a broader category than the original word.

These examples seem to follow a different pattern. The missing element is not given in the examples, but you can probably figure it out based on what the task is supposed to accomplish.

It seems that in these examples, the question is "predict the category of word X that is more general than Y"

The patterns I mentioned before weren't applicable here, that's why I called them out late.

And the question is predict the tail entity [MASK] from the given (vomiting, _hypernym of , [MASK]) by completing the sentence "[the answer] can be a broader category of the word vomiting?
